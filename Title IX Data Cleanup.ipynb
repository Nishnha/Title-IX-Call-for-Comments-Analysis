       "      <td>As a lawyer who once practiced education and civil-rights law, I request that the Education Department rescind the definition of \"significant disproportionality\" in 34 C.F.R.  300.647, and adopt a definition that is less onerous for local education agencies. As I explain in my attached comments, the current definition places pressure on them to adopt veiled racial quotas in special education services, which violates the Constitution.\\n\\nThe definition comes from the Obama administration's December 19, 2016 rule dealing with grants and assistance under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) governing the Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities program and the Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities program. See Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Assistance to States for the Education of Children With Disabilities; Preschool Grants for Children With Disabilities, 81 Fed. Reg. 92376 (Dec. 19, 2016). \\n \\nThe rule, now found at 34 C.F.R.  300.646 &amp; 300.647, is problematic, because the rule will pressure school districts to violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal-protection clause through its definition of \"significant disproportionality.\" See 34 C.F.R.  300.647 (interpreting 20 U.S.C.  1418(d)(1)'s reference to \"significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity\"); 34 C.F.R. 300.647(a)(1)&amp;(a)(6) (defining disproportionality in terms of comparisons between \"one racial or ethnic group\" and \"all other racial and ethnic groups\").  \\n \\nThe notice containing the final version of the rule ignored the agency's duty to interpret laws so as to avoid potential constitutional problems. The rule interprets \"significant disproportionality\" as being based on a crude comparison of the number of minorities versus number of whites with a particular outcome or classification - rather than whether the outcome or classification was more accurate for members of one race rather than another due to disproportionate failure to evaluate members of a particular race correctly. The rule compares the \"outcome for children in one racial or ethnic group\" not with the correct outcome, but with the \"outcome for children in all other racial or ethnic groups.\" See 34 C.F.R.  300.647(a)(1)&amp;(a)(6). \\n\\nThere was a plausible alternative interpretation of \"significant disproportionality\" that did not raise any potential constitutional problem (one focusing on skewed process rather than outcome, such as whether economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to appropriate identification or placement skewed the process against a minority group). \\n\\nSo there was no reason to adopt the interpretation contained in the rule, which punishes LEA's for not achieving a racial quota in identification of children as disabled. If regulated entities do not achieve \"significant disproportionality,\" even for reasons beyond their control, 15% of their funds are diverted to coordinated, early intervening services. See 34 CFR  300.647(d)&amp;(e).\\n \\nRacial-balance requirements in special education are unconstitutional. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 538 (7th Cir. 1997) (overturning provision in court \"decree\" that \"limits minority enrollment in compensatory education (that is, remedial) programs to the percentage of minority students in the school as a whole. These programs are designed largely although not entirely for minority students, because they have on average more educational deficits. To forbid these students access to these programs on the ground that it would foster unfavorable stereotypes is the kind of 'benign discrimination' thinking ...that the courts have long rejected\").\\n \\nSo the rule was wrong to financially penalize school districts for not achieving such racial balance. Doing so ignored settled canons of statutory construction. Statutes should not be interpreted as pressuring regulated entities to use race unless there is no plausible alternative reading of the law. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 923 (1995) (\"Although we have deferred to the [Justice] Department's interpretation in certain statutory cases . . . we have rejected agency interpretations to which we would otherwise defer where they raise serious constitutional questions. . . When the Justice Department's interpretation of the Act compels race-based districting, it by definition raises a serious constitutional question . . . and should not receive deference\"); Lutheran Church v. FCC, 141 F.3d 344 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (pressure on regulated entity to use race was unconstitutional). \\n\\nPenalizing an entity for not meeting \"racial targets or quotas\" raises \"difficult constitutional questions,\" even when the entity has previously been found guilty of discrimination (which is not the case for the regulated entities subject to this rule). See Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2524 (2015).</td>\n",

That role is as important today as it was when the\\nElementary and Secondary Education Act and the Higher Education Act passed in 1965. The U.S.\\nDepartment of Education has a responsibility to advance equity by implementing regulations that ensure\\nthat states, localities, and institutions are living up to the purpose of federal legislation and providing\\nequitable opportunities to all students.\\nAs the Department conducts its review of the existing regulations, we ask you to keep the interests of all\\nstudents, particularly the most vulnerable, in front of mind. This means maintaining, and in some cases\\nstrengthening, existing regulations that are meant to protect students.\\nThis letter outlines our views on key regulations we believe are most important to promoting student\\nsuccess. For more information or further discussion, please contact Kelly McManus, Director of\\nGovernment Affairs at The Education Trust, at kmcmanus@edtrust.org or 202-293-1217, x. 359.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDaria Hall\\nVice President for Government Affairs and Communications\\nThe Education Trust\\n\\n1250 H STREET N.W., SUITE 700\\n\\nWASHINGTON, DC 20005\\n\\nT 202.293.1217\\n\\nF 202.293.2605\\n\\nW W W .

Consistent, high expectations linked to the demands of postsecondary education are critical for\\nensuring that all students \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just some \\xe2\\x80\\x94 get access to meaningful learning opportunities that prepare\\nthem for success after high school.\\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act took a significant step forward in ensuring each state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic standards\\nin mathematics, reading or language arts, and science represent the knowledge and skills students need to\\nbe successful in postsecondary education and the workforce.i The regulation should be updated to align\\nwith this new statutory requirement.\\nAssessment - \\xc2\\xa7200.2 - \\xc2\\xa7200.9; \\xc2\\xa7200.104 - \\xc2\\xa7200.108\\nStatewide, annual assessments aligned with state standards are an important way of measuring student\\nprogress consistently across classrooms, schools, and districts. They provide parents with objective\\ninformation about whether their children are academically on track. They help educators benchmark the\\nperformance of their students against those across the state. And they give parents and the public an\\nobjective measure of how schools are doing at improving learning for all groups of students.\\nIn 2016, the negotiated rulemaking committee came to a consensus on the regulations now in place. That\\nconsensus highlighted the need for assessments not only to be rigorous and comparable, but also to reflect\\nthe needs of vulnerable populations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including English learners and students with disabilities. This\\nregulation should be maintained in its current form.\\nRegarding the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority, we appreciate the potential of this pilot\\nprogram to leverage new and ongoing advances in the assessment field. Yet this innovation cannot come at\\nthe cost of assessment rigor and comparability, which would undermine the central equity tenet\\nundergirding assessments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the value of the common measurement.

That guidance included\\nwhat amounts to a regulatory \\xe2\\x80\\x9cre-definition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of competitive integrated employment that is neither\\na part of the WIOA law nor does it reflect the intent of Congress.\\nThe re-definition of competitive integrated employment targets the AbilityOne Program and\\nparticipating non-profit agencies across the country as ineligible to be considered competitive\\nintegrated employment settings simply because they affirmatively hire persons with disabilities.\\nMoreover, the guidance being promulgated by the RSA strips persons with significant disabilities,\\nwho express an interest in becoming employed or are receiving supports to maintain employment,\\nof state vocational rehabilitation support. The AbilityOne Program is the largest source of\\nemployment in the United States for individuals who are blind or have significant disabilities.\\n\\n\\x0cThe employment settings that these individuals work within are among the most diverse settings\\nin the country and include installations within all branches of the military and virtually every\\ndepartment and agency of the Federal government. AbilityOne employment includes full\\nprevailing wages and benefits and significant promotional and outplacement opportunities.\\nThis guidance and the understanding of the AbilityOne Program is simply wrong. ServiceSource\\nis proud to be one of more than 550 non-profit businesses across the country who create jobs with\\nour government partners in the AbilityOne Program and with private employers for persons with\\nsignificant disabilities. ServiceSource has a 35-year history of participation in the AbilityOne\\nProgram and currently employs or facilitates the employment of more than 1,000 persons with\\nsignificant disabilities in integrated AbilityOne employment settings in over 75 Federal\\ninstallations. Nearly 70 percent of the persons employed came to our organization through the\\nsupport and referral of state vocational rehabilitation.\\nUnfortunately, referrals from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased in many states\\nin which we operate, citing restrictive guidance from the RSA. Jobs are going un-filled and job\\ncreation for persons with the most barriers to employment is slowing dramatically as a result.\\nOther non-profits across the country that participate in the AbilityOne Program are reporting\\nsimilar impacts. In fact, since this change in definition became effective in September 2016, state\\nvocational rehabilitation agencies in 20 states are no longer making referrals for employment\\nwithin AbilityOne settings.\\nWe greatly support this Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common sense approach to identifying and removing\\njob- stifling regulations. Although the balance of the regulations contained in ED-2015-OSERS001-1167 are not at issue, this singular re-definition of competitive integrated employment causes\\nserious harm to job seekers with significant disabilities and job creating organizations across the\\ncountry. We hope you will rescind RSA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s improper re-definition of competitive integrated\\nemployment and require strong direction to the field restoring previous definition, guidance and\\npractice.\\nI would be pleased to speak more with the members of the Task Force should you require further\\ninformation. I can be reached at: Janet.Samuelson@servicesource.org or at 703-461-6000.\\nThank you for your consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJanet Samuelson\\nPresident/CEO\\n\\n\\x0c'</td>\n",

A great way to restore\\nlocal control would be rescind the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s federal micromanagement of college\\ndiscipline. Under Obama, the Education Department sometimes pressured colleges to do things\\nthat could lead to lawsuits being filed against them by their students.\\nFor example, the Education Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s April 4, 2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letter urged colleges\\nto restrict cross-examination in sexual harassment and assault cases. As its Office for Civil\\nRights (OCR) put it in that letter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOCR strongly discourages schools from allowing the parties\\npersonally to question or cross-examine each other during the hearing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When schools take that\\nadvice, it can violate a student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights under a state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Administrative Procedure Act\\n(APA). Under many state APAs, students have a right to cross-examine their accuser, as courts\\nhave made clear in cases such as Arishi v. Washington State University, 385 P.3d 251 (Wash.\\nApp. 2016) and Liu v. Portland State University, 383 P.3d 294 (Or. App. 2016).\\n(It is conceivable that the advice in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letter could also lead to violations of\\nfederal law at colleges that follow it. In a few campus disciplinary cases, such as Donohue v.\\nBaker, 976 F.Supp. 136 (N.D.N.Y. 1997), and Doe v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 2016 WL 6996194\\n(S.D. Oh. 2016), judges have ruled that some cross-examination was constitutionally required on\\ndue-process grounds to test the credibility of the accuser. But the Supreme Court has not ruled on\\nwhether cross-examination is ever required by the federal constitution in the college setting, even\\nthough it lauded cross-examination as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery\\nof truth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in its decision in Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 124 (1999).)\\nThe Education Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Letter purported to apply the federal sex\\ndiscrimination law Title IX. But it misconstrued Title IX, as I explain in detail at this link.\\nMoreover, in advising colleges to restrict the rights of their students, it ignored language in a\\n1999 Supreme Court ruling that emphasized that schools don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to risk violating the rights of\\ntheir students to comply with Title IX. In setting forth a standard for when schools need to take\\naction against sexual harassment or assault by students, the Supreme Court said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nstandard set out here is sufficiently flexible to account both for the level of disciplinary authority\\navailable to the school and for the potential liability arising from certain forms of disciplinary\\naction. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 [I]t would be entirely reasonable for a school to refrain from a form of disciplinary\\n\\n\\x0caction that would expose it to constitutional or statutory claims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (See Davis v. Monroe County\\nBoard of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 649 (1999)).\\nThe Supreme Court plainly meant to allow colleges to avoid acting in ways giving rise to\\nstatutory claims against them under both federal and state law, since it was in response to a\\ndissenting opinion that cited both federal and state laws limiting the ability of schools to\\ndiscipline students (such as state constitutional provisions. See Davis, at pg. 649, citing the\\ndissenting opinion in Davis, at pp. 666-668).\\nIn addition to ignoring the Supreme Court, this Obama-era \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letter also wrongly\\nimposed new obligations on schools without notice and comment, in violation of the\\nAdministrative Procedure Act (as I explained earlier). For example, it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cignored past Office for\\nCivil Rights rulings authored by its own career lawyers and civil servants in forcing colleges to\\ninvestigate off-campus conduct. Such \\xe2\\x80\\x98unexplained departures from precedent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are arbitrary and\\ncapricious, as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals noted in Ramaprakash v. FAA (2003). The\\nObama administration also ignored two federal appeals court rulings, and language in a Supreme\\nCourt decision, by demanding that colleges do so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn its April 4, 2011 letter, the Office for Civil Rights told colleges they \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave an obligation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to\\ninvestigate even when an incident \\xe2\\x80\\x9coccurred off school grounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This contradicted what OCR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncareer staff told colleges in Title IX rulings during the Bush administration, when I worked t...</td>\n",

That is what the Department of Education\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office for Civil Rights, where I used to work,\\nexpects schools to do, regarding rapes committed by students. Given the trauma of rape, it is\\nhard to imagine how a school could do that.\\nOn April 29, 2014, the Education Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) told schools they\\nmust do this in order to comply with the federal law Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in\\neducational institutions.

These improper mandates also conflicted with federal appeals court rulings about whether Title IX reaches off-campus conduct, and also conflicted with past administrative rulings by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (such as about appeal rights and regulation of off-campus conduct). And they improperly pressured colleges to restrict cross-examination by the accused, even though the right of the accused to personally cross-examine the accuser is specifically protected by some court rulings and state Administrative Procedures Acts.\\n\\nAttached are two articles I published at CNS News explaining why the Dear Colleague Letter and the 2014 \"Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence\" should be rescinded. The first focuses on the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, the second on the 2014 guidance. (See (1) Hans Bader, \"Time to End Obama-Era Fed Micromanagement of Colleges Under Title IX,\" Feb. 22, 2017, available at http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/time-end-obama-era-fed-micromanagement-colleges-under-title-ix ; (2) Bader,\"Obama-Era DOE Instructions Disregard SCOTUS Interpretation of Title IX,\" CNS News, Feb. 27, 2017, available at http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/obama-era-doe-instructions-disregard-scotus-interpretation-title-ix ).\\n\\nThe first two attachments are these articles in Microsoft Word.\\nThe last two attachments are these articles in PDF form.\\n\\nThese articles discuss court rulings at odds with the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 guidance, such as Roe v. St. Louis University, 746 F.3d 874, 884 (8th Cir. 2014), which held that a university had no responsibility over an off-campus rape, and past OCR rulings at odds with them, such as an Office for Civil Rights ruling in 2004 that a University does not have a duty under Title IX to address an incident of alleged harassment where the incident occurs off-campus and does not involve a program or activity of the recipient. See Oklahoma State University ruling, OCR Complaint No. 06-03-2054, at pg. 2 (June 10, 2004). They also discuss past administrative rulings inconsistent with the Dear Colleague letter's restrictions on appeals, such as the Office for Civil Rights' Skidmore College, University of Cincinnati, and Suffolk University Law School rulings in 1996, 2006, and 2008, respectively.</td>\n",

I am recommending the Department rescind its special\\neducation guidance in Letter to Cox and Letter to Ward (see attachments) for t he f ollowing reasons:\\nLetter to Cox, issued by OSEP on August 21, 2009, addresses the question of what LEAs are required to\\ndo when t wo parents, both with legal authority to make educational decisions for their child, disagree\\non the revocation of consent for special education and related services. This letter makes the following\\nconclusions:\\n1. Under 34 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 300.9(c), a parent may revoke consent for his or her child\\'s receipt of special\\neducation and related services.\\n2. Under 34 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 300.30(b)(l), when more than one person is qualified to act as a parent, the\\nbiological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent.\\n3. Therefore, the LEA must accept either parent\\'s revocation of consent and provide both parents w ith\\nprior written notice before ceasing special education and related services.\\n4. After revocation of consent, if the still consenting parent requests services for the student, the\\nrequest must be treated as a request for an initial evaluation. With this reasoning, the revoking parent\\nmay revoke that consent for the initial evaluation, and if so, the LEA must provide a prior written notice\\nceasing the evaluation, whereupon, the consenting parent may subsequently again request an initial\\n\\n\\x0cevaluation. In the meantime, an identified student who has a consenting parent is denied his or her\\nright under the law to receive a Free Appropriate Public Education.\\n5. The consenting parent does not have a right to a due process hearing to contest the revocation of\\nconsent because the revocation of consent is not an action by a public agency.\\n6. The public agency does not have a right to request a due process hearing because 34 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7\\n300.300(b)(4)(ii) precludes due process procedures to obtain a ruling that the services may be provided\\nto the student.\\nI believe the flaws contained in this guidance are that:\\nConclusion 2 is based on a regulation providing a parent with a right to revoke consent for special\\neducation services to his or her child. It does not take into account the fact that, in the scenario\\ndescribed in Letter to Cox, there are more than one persons qualified to act as a parent, but both are\\nbiological parents. Thus, the regulation requires both parents to be presumed to be the parent of the\\nchild. Both are presumed to have a right to provide consent, or revoke consent, for services. The\\nregulation itself, however, does not address this particular situation, where the competing parents are\\nboth presumed t o be the parent.\\nConclusion 3 favors a revoking parent over a consenting parent, when there is nothing in the regulation\\nthat requires this conclusion, and directly results in a child with a disability being denied a Free\\nAppropriate Public Education.\\nConclusion 5 is incorrect. The consenting parent does have a right to a due process hearing. The\\nconsenting parent does not have to allege that the revocation of consent is improper, and does not have\\nto bring the due process action against the revoking parent. Rather, the consent ing parent, after\\nreceiving a prior written notice from the LEA notifying the consenting parent that the LEA is proposing to\\nend services, retains the right to request a due process against the LEA to challenge the LEA\\'s decision to\\nend services to a student: (a) that it has evaluated and found eligible for special education services; (b)\\nthat it has developed an IEP it believes the student needs to receive FAPE; and (c) f or whom it has\\ncurrent parent consent to provide the services specified in that IEP. Not only does the consenting\\nparent continue to have this right, when the equities of the case are presented to an impartial hearing\\nofficer, the consenting parent is likely to be the prevailing party. That would result in an LEA which\\nfollows the guidance in Letter to Cox being ...</td>\n",

We submit these comments to express our support of the 2011 Title IX Dear Colleague Letter including the clarification by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the correct evidentiary standard for sexual harassment cases (preponderance of the evidence). \\n\\nSexual violence is widespread and devastating to survivors. The clarifications in the Dear Colleague guidance were needed and welcome because of the serious, discriminatory harms that victims of sexual face as a result of their experiences and entrenched victim blaming attitudes. \\n\\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letters clarifications of OCRs previous regulatory guidance and enforcement actions are fully consistent with the civil rights approach to discriminatory harassment and the rules in the vast majority of other civil proceedings.  Indeed, if OCR had adopted a different approach, it would have engaged in a dangerous kind of exceptionalism for only sexual violence and its victims, the majority of whom are women and girls.  \\n\\nThe preponderance of the evidence standard has been required by OCR in sexual harassment and violence cases for over two decades and through both Democratic and Republican presidencies.  The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter helped schools to better understand OCRs long-standing practice regarding this standard and, in doing so, helped protect schools from expensive liability by explaining how schools can better protect their students.  \\n\\nWe urge the U.S. Department of Education to keep the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter in place as extraordinarily helpful existing clarifying guidance articulating necessary, legally correct, and historically-followed standards that help both students and schools.\\n\\nFor further information about our positions on key issues related to sexual violence protections for students, please see our position paper: Responding to Campus Sexual Assault: Key Issues (attached). \\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>b'Responding to Campus Sexual Assault\\nKey Issues\\nMay, 2017\\nSeveral studies of campus sexual assault have confirmed that the incidence is high with significant\\nconsequences for survivors including high rates of PTSD, depression, and drug or alcohol abuse, which\\ncan hamper both their ability to succeed in school and future employment. At the same time, only a\\nsmall percentage of these cases are reported, sanctioned by campus judicial boards, or prosecuted,\\nallowing offenders, who will often have multiple victims, to go without punishment as well as creating\\nan unsafe environment for students. Responses to campus sexual assault must support survivors,\\nuphold current available protections, and improve prevention with the following priorities in mind:\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\nOppose any efforts to undermine the Department of Education 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and\\nsupport efforts to enforce Title IX;\\nSupport partnerships between schools and community-based rape crisis centers;\\nSupport survivors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to confidential advocacy and accommodations;\\nMaintain and improve campus processes with standards befitting a non-criminal, internal\\nproceeding to respond to sexual misconduct. Reject mandatory reporting policies and\\nconflating the criminal justice system and campus response; and\\nExpand the availability of comprehensive prevention; training; and climate surveys.\\n\\nPartnerships: Institutions have a prime opportunity to make significant and lasting change by integrating\\ncomprehensive sexual assault services and prevention through all aspects of campus life. State sexual assault\\ncoalitions and community-based rape crisis centers are experts in sexual violence with decades of experience\\nconducting sexual assault training and prevention education as well as building an evidence base founded in\\npractice and the real experiences of communities. Only community-based rape crisis center staff can ensure\\nconfidential communication with victims and have no conflict of interest since they are not university\\nemployees. They stand ready to work with colleges and universities to implement services, prevention and\\ntraining programming. We strongly urge institutions to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\\nwith a local, community-based rape crisis center or other program serving survivors and/or the state sexual\\nassault coalition. MOUs could include, but should not be limited to:\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\nAn agreement, including fee structure, for the rape crisis center to provide confidential victim\\nservices;\\nAn agreement and fee structure for the rape crisis center or state sexual assault coalition to provide\\ncase consultation and training to confidential advisors;\\nConsultation and provision of prevention education programs; consultation and provision of staff\\ntraining;\\n\\n\\x0c\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\nDevelopment of training and/or prevention curricula;\\nOffice space for a rape crisis center advocate to meet with victims;\\nReview of policies and procedures related to sexual assault; and\\nParticipation in a campus sexual assault task force and/or SART team.\\n\\nAdvocacy &amp; Confidentiality: The cornerstone of rape crisis advocacy is empowering survivors to regain control\\nby making their own decisions following sexual assault. Campuses are tasked with preventing these crimes,\\nsupporting survivors, creating a safe learning environment and holding offenders accountable. In doing this, we\\nmust keep the needs of survivors central to this process by granting advocates confidentiality when supporting\\nsurvivors on campuses.\\nMandatory reporting policies requiring campuses to report sexual assaults to local law enforcement are\\nunacceptable, even with an opt-out provision. Survivors must be apprised of the avenues and procedures for\\nreporting as well as advocacy assistance in making and following through with reports. However, the decision to\\nreport must be the survivor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. NAESV and Know Your IX conducted an internet survey in March 2015.\\nAlmost 90% of survivors responded \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they should retain the choice whether and to whom to report.

Indeed, if OCR had adopted a different approach, it would have engaged in a dangerous kind of exceptionalism for only sexual violence and its victims, the majority of whom are women and girls. \\n\\nOn behalf of survivors, state sexual assault coalitions and local programs serving survivors and providing prevention education in their communities, we urge the U.S. Department of Education to keep the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter in place as extraordinarily helpful existing regulatory guidance articulating necessary, legally correct, and historically-followed standards that help both students and schools.\\n\\nPlease see the attached position paper which goes into more detail on our views on these critical issues. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>b'Responding to Campus Sexual Assault\\nKey Issues\\nMay, 2017\\nSeveral studies of campus sexual assault have confirmed that the incidence is high with significant\\nconsequences for survivors including high rates of PTSD, depression, and drug or alcohol abuse, which\\ncan hamper both their ability to succeed in school and future employment. At the same time, only a\\nsmall percentage of these cases are reported, sanctioned by campus judicial boards, or prosecuted,\\nallowing offenders, who will often have multiple victims, to go without punishment as well as creating\\nan unsafe environment for students. Responses to campus sexual assault must support survivors,\\nuphold current available protections, and improve prevention with the following priorities in mind:\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\nOppose any efforts to undermine the Department of Education 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and\\nsupport efforts to enforce Title IX;\\nSupport partnerships between schools and community-based rape crisis centers;\\nSupport survivors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to confidential advocacy and accommodations;\\nMaintain and improve campus processes with standards befitting a non-criminal, internal\\nproceeding to respond to sexual misconduct. Reject mandatory reporting policies and\\nconflating the criminal justice system and campus response; and\\nExpand the availability of comprehensive prevention; training; and climate surveys.\\n\\nPartnerships: Institutions have a prime opportunity to make significant and lasting change by integrating\\ncomprehensive sexual assault services and prevention through all aspects of campus life. State sexual assault\\ncoalitions and community-based rape crisis centers are experts in sexual violence with decades of experience\\nconducting sexual assault training and prevention education as well as building an evidence base founded in\\npractice and the real experiences of communities. Only community-based rape crisis center staff can ensure\\nconfidential communication with victims and have no conflict of interest since they are not university\\nemployees. They stand ready to work with colleges and universities to implement services, prevention and\\ntraining programming. We strongly urge institutions to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\\nwith a local, community-based rape crisis center or other program serving survivors and/or the state sexual\\nassault coalition. MOUs could include, but should not be limited to:\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\nAn agreement, including fee structure, for the rape crisis center to provide confidential victim\\nservices;\\nAn agreement and fee structure for the rape crisis center or state sexual assault coalition to provide\\ncase consultation and training to confidential advisors;\\nConsultation and provision of prevention education programs; consultation and provision of staff\\ntraining;\\n\\n\\x0c\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7\\n\\nDevelopment of training and/or prevention curricula;\\nOffice space for a rape crisis center advocate to meet with victims;\\nReview of policies and procedures related to sexual assault; and\\nParticipation in a campus sexual assault task force and/or SART team.\\n\\nAdvocacy &amp; Confidentiality: The cornerstone of rape crisis advocacy is empowering survivors to regain control\\nby making their own decisions following sexual assault. Campuses are tasked with preventing these crimes,\\nsupporting survivors, creating a safe learning environment and holding offenders accountable. In doing this, we\\nmust keep the needs of survivors central to this process by granting advocates confidentiality when supporting\\nsurvivors on campuses.\\nMandatory reporting policies requiring campuses to report sexual assaults to local law enforcement are\\nunacceptable, even with an opt-out provision. Survivors must be apprised of the avenues and procedures for\\nreporting as well as advocacy assistance in making and following through with reports. However, the decision to\\nreport must be the survivor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. NAESV and Know Your IX conducted an internet survey in March 2015.\\nAlmost 90% of survivors responded \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they should retain the choice whether and to whom to report. When\\nasked their concerns if reporting to police were mandatory, 79% said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis could have a chilling effect on\\nreporting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while 72% were concerned that \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurvivors would be forced to participate in the criminal justice\\nsystem/go to trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAt the same time, it is essential for campuses to rigorously investigate reported sexual assaults and proactively\\nlook for patterns of perpetration. Campuses must be clear which employees have a duty to report as a\\nresponsible employee and which employees can guard confidentiality, by providing statistics for Clery Act\\nreporting that are de-identified and ensure a method of sharing information about specific crimes with...</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am a Lecturer on Law and the founding Director of the Gender Violence Program at Harvard Law School. I have taught a course on Title IX every year since 2007. I have previously served as Senior Counsel in the Office on Violence Against Women at the US Department of Justice, and prior to that served as an Executive Assistant Attorney General in Illinois.  I worked with the Department of Education in the Obama Administration on its initiatives to address the national problem of campus sexual violence. The Harvard Law School Gender Violence Program contributed to the work of the White House Task Force on Protecting Students from Sexual Assault in 2014. I have worked with students across the country on this problem, helping survivors retain an educational foothold in the aftermath of an assault. I have worked with schools in achieving compliance with Title IX and have lectured extensively on the topic. I also appear in The Hunting Ground, an acclaimed documentary on campus sexual assault.\\n\\nThe Gender Violence Program partners with Futures Without Violence and the University of Virginia to offer a curriculum on Changing the Narrative on Gender-Based Violence on Campus. It includes best practices on a school's duties to prevent, respond and resolve cases of sexual misconduct under Title IX. We offer this curriculum with a faculty of national experts on violence prevention and provide it regionally across the country. \\n\\nI have attached two recent articles of mine-one from the Harvard Law Review regarding \"target rapes\" on campus; the other a recent opinion editorial published in the Washington Post. I have other publications available on request.  I am a signatory to the White Paper on the preponderance standard submitted by Professor Nancy Chi Cantalupo and others.\\n\\nI write to support the OCR DCL of April 2011 and to urge the DOE not to abandon the considerable work it has done to enforce Title IX's important equality guarantees. The DOE should continue advising schools on fair implementation of their responsibilities to prevent and address campus sexual assault. Special rights for the accused is not legally consistent with the civil rights provisions of Title IX. Fair process, as provided for in the 2011 DCL and the Campus SaVE Act, mandates equal treatment for both sides with an emphasis on victim safety, public safety, and offender accountability. Schools must be able to keep their campuses safe for all students. Each of the problems cited by Secretary DeVos to justify scrapping the DCL was a Title IX violation--not a problem caused by compliance with an unfair regulation. It is urgently necessary to work with schools on the fair implementation of policies and procedures to effect Title IX's promise of equal access to educational opportunities. Creating a new evidentiary standard of clear and convincing would be confusing to schools; would create a discriminatory system for sexual violence cases when preponderance of the evidence is the standard for all other civil rights cases; and in itself would create an unnecessary regulatory morass rather than streamlining regulation as requested in this evaluation of existing regulations. Rather, the DOE should work with schools on fair processes as currently required--if one party has a right to present evidence, have counsel, or to appeal, etc.,  so too does the other party. DOE should ensure schools have trained investigators and adjudicators and trauma-informed responses so that a student reporting sexual misconduct is not further harmed in terms of access to educational opportunities. It should help schools to explore resolutions that promote the purpose of Title IX. The building blocks for such important action have been set, and the DOE should continue this work, but not by overreacting to claims of the accused and their academic supporters who imagine having been struck down by a pendulum swing in favor of victims or survivors of sexual assault. For years, sexual offenders were getting away with assaulting other students on campus. If we don't hold offenders accountable, the scourge of sexual violence on college campuses will continue unabated. The 2011 DCL is a critical guidance document to schools to help them achieve compliance with Title IX's civil rights provisions. While the DOE can and should continue to hold schools accountable to provide fair processes, changing substantially the evidentiary standard would signify a retreat on its important enforcement role. Moreover, it would be legally inconsistent with civil rights and anti-discrimination laws, and thus would lead to unnecessary and avoidable excessive litigation. The current comments ask how to reduce regulations--I respectfully submit that such reduction can be achieved by continuing a regulatory framework already in place rather than disrupting it. To do so will subvert the stated purpose of this evaluation of existing regulations. \\n\\nSee attached file(s)</td>\n",

As Director of the Health Justice Project at Loyola University Chicago\\nSchool of Law, a medical-legal partnership clinic working to improve the health and well-being\\nof vulnerable children and families, and as an advocate for at risk children and children with\\ndisabilities for over 17 years, I write to ask the Department to ensure the continued protection of\\nthe rights of these vulnerable populations to access a meaningful education. The Department can\\ncontinue to support the opportunities of every student as well as the right of their parents to\\nenable their success through the preservation of the protective implementing regulations and\\nguidance for the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the\\nRehabilitation Act, continued support for the implementation of the Equity in IDEA rules\\nproposed by the Department in February of 2016, and maintain the Guiding Principles: A\\nResource Guide for Improving School Climate and Discipline, the joint guidance package on\\nschool discipline issued by the USDOE and the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) on January\\n8, 2014.

We believe the regulations\\naddressed in these comments interfere with the provision of services to the intended customers,\\nbut that fairly simple modifications can remedy these situations.\\nFocusing attention on transition age students is a necessary part of increasing their overall chances\\nto eventually achieve competitive employment. However, by allocating 15% of the federal dollars\\nreceived to Pre-ETS services when no additional funding was provided, already shrinks the funding\\nfor other customers. To additionally exclude the services that are provided to Pre-ETS customers\\nwho have an Individualized Plan for Employment from that 15% can affect the continuity of the\\nservices provided while placing an even greater strain on the provision of services to other\\ncustomers. While later clarifications have included certain activities, postsecondary tuition and fees\\nare still excluded. Specifically, the policy statement in the preamble of 34 C.F.R 361 states:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6a DSU may not use the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services to pay for tuition and\\nother costs of attending postsecondary education, since this is not among those activities that are\\nrequired or authorized under section 113 of the Act and final Section 361.48(a).\\n\\nYet, some aspects of postsecondary education appear to be acceptable in a response in the preamble\\nof the regulation which says:\\n\\nNonetheless, we agree that section 7(37) of the Act, as amended by WIOA, is silent on the\\neducational setting for a student with a disability. After much consideration of the potential\\neffects for such change in interpretation, the Secretary agrees that the definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstudent\\nwith a disability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in final section 361.5(c)(51) for purposes of the VR program, should be\\ninterpreted as applying to students also enrolled in educational programs outside secondary\\nschool, including postsecondary education programs, so long as the students satisfy the age\\nrequirements set forth in final section 361.5(c)(51).\\n\\n\\x0cWhat this means is that much effort is made to prepare a student to successfully navigate gaining\\nan education according to the IPE, only to find that the financial support for which they may\\notherwise qualify may not be available. This exclusion seems arbitrary and should be\\neliminated.\\nA second closely related concern is the possible interruption of service provision that arises from\\nthe separation between Pre-ETS funds and the funding of services once a customer has applied\\nfor rehabilitation services. When \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrder of Selection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is active, it is possible for a transition\\naged customer to be left without services while in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9corder of selection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d window. At the very\\nleast, Pre-ETS funding should be available until vocational rehabilitation services begin.\\nAnother area of concern of our council has been improving the rate of successful closures. We\\nare therefore concerned with the requirement that a case be closed if an Individualized Plan for\\nEmployment is not in place within 90 days of the determination of eligibility for services.\\nSpecifically, regulation 34 C.F.R. 361.45(e) requires that \\xe2\\x80\\x9can IPE be in place not later than 90\\ndays after the date of determination of eligibility, unless the State unit and the eligible individual\\nagree to the extension of that deadline to a specific date by which the individualized plan for\\nemployment must be completed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If unanticipated circumstances prevent a customer from\\nreturning an IPE, for example, such circumstances will likely prevent the agreement for an\\nextension to be completed as well. If a customer has been determined to be eligible and the state\\nagency and the customer have begun to work together to produce an IPE, a case should not be\\nclosed because a customer has not, for example, returned that IPE. While the intent of this\\nregulation is likely to encourage prompt action from the state agency while avoiding the\\nmaintenance of open cases where customers have lost interest, there is a good deal of middle\\nground that should be more clearly defined.\\nCertainly there are additional regulations that deserve review, but the above would seem to have\\nfairly simple solutions. Thank you for considering our comments.\\nBest regards,\\nSteve Jacobson, Chair\\nMinnesota State Rehabilitation Council \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Blind\\n\\n\\x0c'</td>\n",

Reg. 28431 (June 22, 2017)\\nED-2017-OS-0074-0001\\n\\nDear Ms. Malawer and Dept. of Education personnel:\\nThis comment supplements my original submission in support of a strong Title IX, including strong\\nsupport for existing regulations and guidance on addressing campus sexual assault.\\nI was compelled to file this supplement to correct mis-representations made by Secretary DeVos in\\nher September 7, 2017, statement about the position of the American Bar Association regarding Title\\nIX. Her statement incorrectly implies that the ABA supports the efforts of the Department of\\nEducation (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDOE) to weaken Title IX, including Title IX guidance on campus sexual assault.\\nI am a longtime member of the ABA and the leadership of the ABA Section of Civil Rights and\\nSocial Justice. As a CRSJ leader, I have fought for ABA policy, educational programs, and amicus\\nbriefs in support of Title IX enforcement. During the 2015-2016 academic year I organized and\\nmoderated a free 6-part educational series on Title IX and Campus Sexual Assault: A Civil Rights\\nPerspective for the American Bar Association. I urge DOE and readers of this comment to review\\nthe materials associated with that series.1 Those materials show why currently Title IX policies must\\nbe vigorously enforced - not weakened. While I file this comment on behalf of myself and not on\\nbehalf of the ABA, I am familiar with ABA policy on the issue and I believe that Secretary DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ncharacterization of that policy is incorrect.\\nSecretary DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99s September 7, 2017, statement on the DOE website states that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe American Bar\\nAssociation established a task force comprised of lawyers and advocates from diverse backgrounds\\nand varying perspectives. They found consensus and offered substantive ideas on how we can do\\nbetter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/secretary-devos-prepared-remarks-title-ix-enforcement.\\nThis statement inaccurately characterizes the task force and the report. The inaccuracy was\\ncompounded by press reports that cited it, asserting that the report and its recommendations\\nconstitute the position and policy of the ABA.1\\n\\n1\\n\\nhttps://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/events_cle/campus-sexual-assault-teleco\\nnference-series--a-civil-rights-pers.html\\nhttps://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/crsj/csawebpage_programmaterials\\n.authcheckdam.pdf\\n\\n\\x0cFirst, the task force was not an ABA task force. It was a Criminal Justice Section task force\\nestablished by and for members of that Section \\xe2\\x80\\x93 criminal lawyers. The ABA Criminal Justice\\nSection does not and cannot speak for the ABA. It is a small part of a very large organization. Only\\npolicy adopted by the ABA House of Delegates can be cited as the policy and position of the ABA\\nitself. The CJS report and recommendations were NOT adopted by the ABA House of Delegates\\nand thus cannot be represented as the position of the ABA.\\nOther groups within the ABA with expertise in Title IX and campus sexual assault \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the\\nABA Section of Civil Rights and Social Justice (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCRSJ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), the ABA Commission on Domestic and\\nSexual Violence (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCDSV), and the ABA Commission on Women in the Profession \\xe2\\x80\\x94 strongly\\nobjected to the composition of the Criminal Justice Section task force, its hastily convened and\\nclosed meetings, the limited nature of the materials provided to its members, and some of the\\nsubstance of the report and recommendations. These groups support strong, vigorous enforcement\\nof existing DOE guidance and were concerned that the CJS work could be wrongly used to weaken\\nit. As a result of this opposition, CJS withdrew its resolution from consideration by the ABA House\\nof Delegates. Accordingly, the report and recommendations were not approved by the ABA House\\nof Delegates and thus are not the policy of the ABA.\\nSecond, the Criminal Justice Section did not establish a task force of lawyers from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiverse\\nbackground and varying perspectives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It set up a task force to look at the issue from a criminal\\njustice standpoint. When the Section of Civil Rights and Social Justice and the Commission on\\nDomestic and Sexual Violence learned about the task force, they asked to participate so that the task\\nforce could hear views from a civil rights perspective. After all, Title IX is a civil rights statute \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nnot a criminal statute. CJS allowed one liaison from each group to participate. Those liaisons were\\nnot allowed to share the workings of the task force with the groups who sent them until CJS had\\nfinished its work. Thus, the entities had no opportunity to provide input or feedback during the\\nprocess.\\nAfter seeing and objecting to multiple parts of t...</td>\n",

       "      <td>b\"Dear Secretary DeVos,\\nI am writing you as a citizen who has been working in the field of sexual violence for nearly a\\ndecade and as someone who works for an academic institution on Title IX issues daily (these\\nare my personal comments don't represent my institution). I have worked on the response side\\nas well as on the prevention side of this issue. As a campus administrator I first feel it is\\nimportant that you know that myself and many of my colleagues have been grateful for the\\nofficial guidance documents published on Title IX over the last few years, as they spoke to and\\naddressed many of the questions we had concerning compliance and provided us with a\\nframework to assist in implementing and further developing institutional practices and\\nprocedures. In fact, since 2015 I have seen a huge benefit to our institution and our students\\nand staff because we have implemented many changes based on the guidance documents. Our\\nstudents trust our institution more than ever to keep them safe and to provide them with\\nknowledge and support if they find themselves involved with a Title IX investigation. This was\\nnot the case before 2015.\\nI agree with you that largely we do have a failed system, but I sincerely believe that the system\\nhas always been a failed system. Since 2015 we have made positive changes in the right\\ndirection. We still have a lot of work to do to make the system work well, but not enforcing these\\ndocuments will do way more harm than help. It is only because of those documents that we\\neven ever found out that the system is failed. Because without those documents and the last\\nadministration's focus on ensuring students were made aware of their rights, most if not all\\nstudents would never have even known that they could file a complaint, that they had rights that\\ntheir institution had to uphold, that there was anything to be done about\\nharassment/discrimination/sexual misconduct.\\nIn your speech, all of your examples illustrate that institutions were not following the law or\\nabiding by OCR guidance - they don't illuminate how OCR guidance is wrong or failing. OCR\\nguidance tells us students should not feel they have to go the process alone, it states\\ninstitutions must enforce due process rights, it states we must get adequate training to do our\\njobs. OCR guidance documents clearly outline that Title IX investigations need to be balanced,\\nimpartial, and fair, providing the same opportunities to both parties.\\nYes, Title IX and OCR guidance documents do not require that an appeal process is provided;\\nhowever, an appeals process is recommended under OCR guidance documents. This small\\nchange from a recommendation to a requirement would be easy to accomplish. I would also\\nsuggest ensuring that if one party has legal representation that the other party is given access\\nto legal representation as well.\\nYou discuss the fact that there is a need for a more precise definition of sexual misconduct.\\nHowever, I would say that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a more precise definition of sexual misconduct itself,\\nwhat we probably do need to have a discussion about is the definitions for various forms of\\nsexual misconduct (sexual assault/rape/domestic violence/stalking). Indeed my own colleagues\\nand I have been discussing this for the last two years. Clery uses one set of definitions put forth\\n\\n\\x0cby the FBI, states put forth their own definitions in state code and often these definitions are not\\nthe same.\\nYou similarly spoke of faculty or students being punished for free speech. Under OCR guidance\\nit has been clear that free speech is protected, and that institutional responsibility to protect\\nstudents from discrimination must be done while respecting free-speech rights.\\nAll in all your problem is with institutions that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t follow OCR guidance nor best practices in\\nthe field. This is an incredibly complex field, one in which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working in and studying for\\nalmost a decade. There is no simple answer. However, if we are committed to continuing to do\\nresearch, to establish and implement best practices then we will be on the right side of this\\nnational conversation. I hope that you join me in my commitment to implementing best practices\\nin this field. Yes, we can improve OCR guidance. We should improve it as we learn more about\\nwhat is best practice. We should not go backward and get rid of everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked for. As\\nthe head of the DOE, I hope you stay committed to helping institutions across this country\\nimplement best practices on their campuses.\\nI appreciate your comments in your speech about testing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cideas with those who know this issue\\nall too well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Professionals in this field, myself included, should certainly have a seat at the table.\\nI urge you to follow through with these statements and am more than happy to contribute to\\nthese conversations.\\nThanks for your time and consideration,\\nSteph...</td>\n",

       "      <td>FR Doc # 2017-13157\\nPlease see attached file: FACE REGULATION COMMENTS; RECOMMENDED TITLE IX DUE PROCESS PROCEDURES\\n\\nFamilies Advocating for Campus Equality (FACE)  submits the attached document in response to request for comments by U.S. Department of Education Proposed Rule: Evaluation of Existing Regulations, in accordance with Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda.\" \\n\\nThe attached document recommends procedures essential to ensure college and university Title IX disciplinary processes provide unbiased assessments of facts and evidence.  FACE's recommendations are based on reports from hundreds of students who have contacted us for support and advocacy over the past several years after being wrongfully accused of or found responsible for sexual misconduct. FACE is the only U.S. organization able to provide numerous student experiences exposing schools' desperate need for explicit guidance on implementing fair and balanced disciplinary procedures. \\n\\nNo one denies that sexual assault, on or off campus, is a heinous crime and those found responsible should be severely punished. However, enacting effective campus sexual assault prevention measures which protect victims while judiciously determining guilt cannot be accomplished in a vacuum. The creation of an effective strategy requires extensive research and consultation with those who possess expertise in many fields, including higher education, sexual violence and the law. \\n\\nSecretary of Education DeVos has received overwhelming support from across the political spectrum for her plan to \"launch a transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\" Widespread public notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides the architecture for Americans' right to influence rules and regulations that will affect them, their organizations and their livelihoods. It is a method by which agencies are held accountable, and compliance provides assurance that agency decisions are fact-based and objective, and not the result of a particular political or social agenda. \\n\\nThe Department of Education Office for Civil Rights' (OCR) attempt to resolve campus sexual misconduct issues through guidance such as its April 4, 2011 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" (DCL), without subjecting it to public notice and comment was well-intentioned but imprudent. The fact that the DCL was issued by unelected and unaccountable government officials seeking to change sexual behavior through public policy undoubtedly has lead to the DCL's many shortcomings and devastating unintended consequences.  Many FACE students suspended or expelled following misguided or result-driven disciplinary processes have suffered tremendous emotional, educational and career-destroying impacts traceable to the 2011 DCL.\\n\\nOCR guaranteed compliance with its directives by subjecting institutions to onerous Title IX investigations, publicizing institutions' names prior to findings of wrongdoing and threatening to withhold their federal funding.  However, the broad responsibilities OCR imposed upon institutions of higher education have been uniformly criticized as unfair, inequitable and generally ineffective at educating students about or preventing sexual misconduct on college and university campuses.  \\n\\nThe 2011 DCL also neglected to provide campuses with tangible tools to accomplish the broad policy goals it sought to achieve. These omissions are particularly troublesome given the fact-specific nature of most campus sexual misconduct disputes and the importance and extreme difficulty of accurately assessing credibility in \"he said/she said\" cases, particularly when alcohol is a factor. As such, the DCL's proscribed policies do not assist campus administrators in negotiating the extremely complex issues inherent in investigating and adjudicating campus sexual misconduct disputes. \\n\\nCourts across the country are increasingly recognizing that schools are not providing the basic fairness one would expect from an institution of higher education and finding that DCL-mandated disciplinary procedures have lead to biased and often predetermined results. There have been nearly seventy decisions in favor of accused students in the past three years, almost thirty of which were decided in 2017 alone.\\n\\nFACE appreciates your consideration of our suggestions to help ensure campus disciplinary proceedings are transparent and unbiased, and individual disciplinary decisions are not motivated by threats of penalties or political pressure to report a threshold number of sexual assaults. We believe the integrity of campus disciplinary decisions will be ensured and prevention efforts more successful when decisions are based on fair procedures, reasonable and objective behavioral standards and the decision-makers' independent evaluation of all available relevant and reliable evidence.\\n\\n</td>\n",

I hope to illustrate through my personal story that the guidance is\\nhelpful, necessary, and should remain in place.\\nAs an adult recently diagnosed with ADHD at age 30, I can look back and see many\\nADHD related struggles I had in K-12. I can also see the continuation of those\\nstruggles in college, in my career, and in my personal life. If the mission of\\nmandatory education in the United States is to prepare individuals to be productive,\\ncontributing members of our society, shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we make an effort to identify\\nneurodiversity so the affected individuals can maximize their abilities? Having\\nguidelines in place that make it easier for teachers and parents to give ADHD\\nstudents the support that will help them to succeed in an evidence-based, effective\\nmanner. The rights of students to access to support without guidelines could result\\nin waste of money, time, and effort on the part of educators and students who need\\nto know what effective support for this disorder means.\\nThe diagnosis of ADHD is life-changing information. One of the most common issues\\nthat adults with ADHD have upon diagnosis is mourning the life that could have\\nbeen. Time management problems, distractibility, focusing on something that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nthe most important part of a project, and chronic procrastination are examples of\\nneurologically driven behaviors for people with ADHD. This can lead to poor\\nperformance in school and in the work place. Adults with ADHD have lived decades\\nthinking they were lazy, lacking in motivation to pursue their dreams and talents,\\nthat they were irresponsible people. Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can lead to\\nfurther mental health issues including depression and anxiety. These additional\\ndisorders are a drain on our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collective productivity. A major cause of these\\nsecondary disorders appear to be repeated failures to accomplish activities that the\\nADHD makes difficult while comparing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self to neurotypical individuals who\\nhave no problem accomplishing the same tasks. With the early knowledge of these\\nweaknesses, a student and later a member of the US workforce can set up systems to\\nmitigate these issues and avoid developing additional mental health issues.\\nAs a gifted student with inattentive ADHD, it is unsurprising that my teachers\\nmissed the signs of my disorder given the stereotypical description of an ADHD kid\\nas a physically out of control boy. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t loud; I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a distraction to other\\nstudents in class. While I daydreamed in school, I was smart enough to put together\\nthe bits and pieces I had paid attention to in order to give the right answer in class\\nmost of the time. But I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ok. The emotional dysregulation aspect of ADHD made\\nembarrassing moments debilitating. Feeling angry, frustrated, or even excited\\n\\n\\x0cwould kill any chance of my learning from the teacher that day. The negative\\nconsequences of strong feelings for the rest of my cognitive capacities had me\\npulling back and avoiding relationships that could potentially cause those feelings.\\nIndividuals who take the opposite tack, as many ADHD individuals do, sacrifice\\neducational attainment while prioritizing building close relationships. Identification\\nwould allow students, teachers, and parents understand the sources of difficulty,\\nallowing them to be addressed.\\nAs a woman who holds a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in a STEM field and will soon hold a\\ndoctorate, I am among the educational elite. Individuals like me lead our society.\\n(https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-raise-a-genius-lessons-froma-45-year-study-of-supersmart-children/) Have I done pretty well in life? Yes.\\nCould I have done better? Yes to that as well. Personally, unstructured work at the\\nend of my doctorate has been an insurmountable challenge without knowledge of\\nADHD. I have lost years of productivity. With the diagnosis and my own discovery of\\nthe research on accommodations for adults I will work around my challenges and\\nfinish my degree this year. I am confident my diagnosis will lead me to doing more\\nfor society than I would have if I failed out of my doctorate program.\\nAs the guidance letter discusses, without the guidance schools had frequently used\\nhigh performance in school as an indicator that a student does not have ADHD or at\\nleast doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need support for their ADHD.

We have spent years researching and advocating for changes to\\nthe laws and practices that push students out of their schools through the use\\nof punitive discipline and the criminalization of school behaviors.\\nWe believe all children deserve a great education and to feel safe and\\nwelcomed in their classrooms. When a school or a school district doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntreat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws require the\\nDepartment of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools\\nunderstand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone\\nunderstands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and\\nguidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law.\\nI support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students\\nreceive the protections and supports they deserve.\\nOur education system is unfair to many students and communities. Students\\nwho are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants,\\nEnglish learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many\\nbarriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to\\nchange that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they\\ndeserve. Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them.\\nWe oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and\\nguidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws. We have relied\\non guidance related to school police, school discipline, and the exclusion of\\nyoung children from their classrooms. We use these tools to advocate for\\nimportant policy changes at the school district and state levels, including a\\nrecent statewide ban on out-of-school suspensions for pre-K through second\\ngraders. Anyone who cares about the success of young people can\\nunderstand the importance of keeping all students, including our youngest\\nstudents, in their classrooms and on the path to graduation\\xe2\\x80\\x94federal\\nregulations and guidance have been an important component of our work to\\nachieve this goal.\\n\\nMelissa B.

These regulations are crucial to\\nproviding access to sports girls of the US.\\nAs evident through Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sports Foundation research, sports provide its\\nparticipants with lifelong benefits (Staurowsky, 2015). Certainly, health is often\\nimproved when an individual participates, but there are other, often less\\ntangible benefits that are earned through a sports experience. Benefits include\\nleadership, workplace advancement, educational achievement, time\\nmanagement, and team work. It is in our best interest as a country to ensure\\nthat such benefits are extended equitably to the women of the United States.\\nNow that we are decades into Title IX\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementation, we can see first-hand\\nthe strong women who have benefitted from a sports experience and gone on\\nto become successful and contributing members of our society, including\\ndoctors, lawyers, politicians, and corporate leaders.\\nIn 1971, a young girl in Connecticut sued for the right to join the boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 crosscountry team, as her school did not have a team for girls. In his decision, the\\njudge asserted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAthletic competition builds character in our boys. We do not\\nneed that kind of character in our girls, the women of tomorrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as cited in\\nBlumenthal, 2005). Times have changed since that 1971 judicial decision. Our\\ncountry is a better more prosperous place because women and girls can now\\naccess sports in our schools. In fact, labor economist Betsey Stevenson used\\nTitle IX as a natural experiment to examine the effect of Title IX on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\neducation and employment. The results are astounding and prove the need for\\nall of our children to have\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHigh school athletics confer substantial economic benefits that last\\nthroughout participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives. When one compares people with similar\\neducational opportunities, family backgrounds, measures of intelligence\\nand self-esteem, the annual wages of former athletes are, on average, 7\\npercent higher than nonathletes. Similarly, athletes get almost half a\\nyear more education than nonathletes. The gains occur equally for girls\\nand boys\\xe2\\x80\\xa6In those states where Title IX led to the greatest expansion in\\nfemale sports, the post-Title IX generation of women enjoyed more\\neducation, employment and higher wages than their pre-Title IX\\nforebears. They were also more likely to enter previously maledominated professions such as law, accounting and even\\nsports.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d(Stevenson &amp; Wolfers, 2012)\\nThe passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has prompted\\nexponential growth in girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to school sports opportunities.\\nIn 1971-72, girls received less than 300,000 high school sports opportunities\\nand 30,000 collegiate sports opportunities (NFHS, 2016; NCAA, 2016). That\\nnumber has since skyrocketed to more than 3.3 million participants in high\\nschool and nearly 215,000 participants in college (NFHS, 2016; NCAA, 2016).\\nWhile there is pride to take in the progress made, we must not forget that\\ninequities still persist. Though high school girls have made great strides, high\\nschool female athletes in 2015-16 have yet to reach the level of boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pre-Title\\nIX participation numbers and they lag behind their male counterparts in current\\nparticipation rates by more than 1.2 million fewer opportunities (NFHS, 2016).\\nHowever, this is not for lack of interest. Girls across the country have proven\\ntime and time again that they are interested in sports. In fact, girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 HS\\nparticipation has increased every year since the 1988-89 school year (NFHS,\\n2016). Not only do participation inequities exist when looking at the country as\\na whole, we see that girls of color are doubly hit by race and gender. An\\nanalysis by the National Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Law Center illustrates this disparity faced by\\ngirls of color, finding that heavily minority schools have fewer sports offerings\\nthan heavily white schools and 40 percent of heavily minority schools versus 16\\npercent of heavily white schools, have large gaps between girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 representation\\nin student body versus their proportional representation in the athletic body.\\nThe existing regulations of Title IX, including the three-part test for\\nparticipation, ensure that our schools have concrete and tangible ways to\\n2\\n\\n\\x0ccomply with the law. These regulations are essential for ensuring we move\\ntowards equity and unleash the full potential of our children. Title IX has done\\ngreat things for our society but inequities persist for our girls. The current rules\\n...</td>\n",

Citizens across the United States are prepared to\\nwage an aggressive grassroots effort to stop The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\\nbecause it promotes Child Abuse in the Classroom. Parents and citizens across the United\\nStates are requesting an immediate injunction to stop the implementation of social, emotional,\\nand behavioral standards and interventions that have been codified in the Every Student\\nSucceeds Act (ESSA) passed and signed into law in December of 2015. Although the\\nimplementation of these non-academic standards and interventions have been previously\\napproved and funded by former President Obama through the Executive Order 12866 and the\\nillegal ESEA Flexibility Waivers, Congress has not stopped the progressive execution of these\\nexperimental, psychological manipulations in the classrooms of America. Because our children\\nare at-risk of abuse, we are calling for an immediate investigation!\\nThe Chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander, had purposely eliminated any\\nreference in his summary reports that would disclose the illegal and dangerous psychological\\ntechniques codified in his ESSA education legislation. Citizens know that Senator Alexander had\\nbeen informed of the abusive mental health interventions that he permitted to be incorporated\\ninto his legislation. We are asking that he publicly recant the language in his bill that opened the\\ndoor to these abuses. We request his immediate resignation if he fails to act forthrightly to\\nremedy this critical situation.\\nPresident Trump has written and released an Executive Order that directs Secretary of\\nEducation DeVos to Enforce Statutory Prohibitions on Federal Control of Education. The Every\\nStudent Succeeds Act legislation violates the protection and safety of our children. This Act\\nrequires the use of abusive psychological techniques on children. These techniques are actually\\ncodified into this law. We request that Secretary DeVos immediately prohibit the use of intrusive\\npsychological and behavioral techniques named in the legislation on America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s children in\\nAmerican classrooms. The Intervention techniques specifically named in the legislation include:\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cApplied Behavior Analysis posing as positive behavior intervention and supports; multi-tiered\\nsystem of supports (response to intervention); school-wide tiered system of supports;\\nspecialized instructional support services; early intervening services for at-risk children or those\\nwho may be at-risk for mental health disabilities; and universal design for learning.\\nThe following list of American citizen and parent grievances explains the wrong-doing through\\nexperimental research and psychological abuse that is currently being done to children in the\\nclassrooms across America:\\nEvery Student Succeeds Act violates the privacy of our children and families.

We strongly believe that all students deserve and are entitled to a quality education in an environment free of violence.  Unfortunately, this is not a reality for many students with marginalized identities, especially students who identify as people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, and Muslims.  When a school or school district perpetrates or allows violence, civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in.  In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We fully support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.  Which is why, we oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\\n\\nThrough our community work, we know firsthand that LGBTQ students face extensive barriers to educational success.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report that found 17.8% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students have been forced to have sexual intercourse compared to 5.4% of heterosexual high school students. The largest national survey examining the experiences of transgender people in the U.S. found that 13% of respondents who were out or perceived as transgender in K-12 were sexually assaulted because of their gender identity. This same report also found that 54% of Transgender K-12 students have experienced verbal harassment, and 24% were physically attacked.  This violence and mistreatment was so pervasive that 17% of transgender students left a K-12 school, and 6% were expelled. For transgender individuals who continued onto college or vocation school, 24% experienced verbal, physical, or sexual harassment during their high education experience. The 2015 AAU Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct determined that 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, and non-conforming) college students have been sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN females, and 4% of non-TGQN males. Any rollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of LGBTQ student survivors, making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they experience their school environments.\\n\\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all students. We urge you not to roll-back these protections. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs\\n</td>\n",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report that\\nfound 17.8% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students have been forced to have sexual\\nintercourse compared to 5.4% of heterosexual high school students.1 The largest national survey\\nexamining the experiences of transgender people in the U.S. found that 13% of respondents who were out\\nor perceived as transgender in K-12 were sexually assaulted because of their gender identity.2 This same\\nreport also found that 54% of Transgender K-12 students have experienced verbal harassment, and 24%\\nwere physically attacked. This violence and mistreatment was so pervasive that 17% of transgender\\nstudents left a K-12 school, and 6% were expelled.2 For transgender individuals who continued onto\\ncollege or vocation school, 24% experienced verbal, physical, or sexual harassment during their high\\neducation experience.2 The 2015 AAU Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct\\ndetermined that 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, and non-conforming) college students have\\nbeen sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN females, and 4% of non-TGQN males. Any\\nrollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of\\nLGBTQ student survivors, making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they\\nexperience their school environments.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Department of Education\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job to help our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s schools provide high-quality education for all\\nstudents.

       "      <td>b'August 21, 2017\\nTo Whom It May Concern:\\nThe Missouri School Boards\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Association is a non-profit organization created by public school board\\nmembers to provide assistance to and to advocate on behalf of Missouri public schools.\\nApproximately 400 school districts are members of MSBA. On behalf of MSBA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s member school\\ndistricts, MSBA submits the following recommendations regarding U.S. Department of Education\\nguidance or regulations:\\n1. Eliminate the FAPE and Special Education Requirements in Section 504 Regulations:\\n34 CFR 104.33 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 104.37.\\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAct\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) has been interpreted by the\\nU.S. Department of Education as requiring districts to provide students a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree and appropriate\\npublic education,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also known as FAPE. 34 CFR 104.33. This regulation goes far beyond what the\\nenacting statute requires, has created confusion regarding a school district\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obligations to students\\nwho are disabled but who do not qualify for special education under the Individuals with Disabilities\\nEducation Act, and have expanded the legal liability of public school districts.\\nThe Act never uses the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree and appropriate public education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it is unclear where this term\\noriginated. MSBA is particularly concerned about the definition of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAppropriate education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nregulations, which requires districts to provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregular or special education and related aids and\\nservices . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 34 CFR 104.33(b(emphasis added). The requirement to provide special education is\\nnot mentioned at all in the Act either. The Act does not require that governmental entities create\\nnew, specialized programs for persons with disabilities. Instead, it prohibits governmental entities\\nfrom excluding persons with disabilities form existing programs or activities.\\nYet the U.S. Department of Education has independently created through these regulations a\\nrequirement for school districts to identify students with disabilities, formally evaluate the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndisability, create \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the student, reevaluate the student, and provide the student\\nprocedural safeguards. 34 CFR 104.33 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 104.37. These obligations go far beyond what was\\nauthorized by the Act, which was to merely provide access to persons with disabilities to existing\\nprograms and services.\\nThese regulations are long overdue for review and revision. The regulations were initially enacted in\\n1980. Aligning the regulations with the enacting statute will provide a more legally sound\\ninterpretation and clarify district obligations under the Act, making it easier for districts to comply\\nand for the Office for Civil Rights to monitor compliance. Further, eliminating reference to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial\\neducation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the process for supplying such education in these regulations will not harm students.\\nA student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to special education is already fully authorized under the Individuals with\\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) and regulations interpreting IDEA.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c2. Revise Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Regulations to Specifically\\nAddress Video Recordings: 34 CFR Part 99\\nVideo recording has become ubiquitous in public school districts. Security cameras are installed in\\nbuildings and on buses. School events such as graduation, music concerts, and athletic events are\\nfrequently recorded. Video is incorporated into lessons and many schools now offer media courses\\nor even host television channels for students. Teachers and administrators include images on district\\nwebsites and in social media. Professional staff even recorded while teaching in the classroom for\\nprofessional development and evaluation purposes. Yet the U.S. Department of Education has yet to\\nadopt specific regulations or guidance interpreting FERPA with the unique issues involved with\\nvideo recording, leaving districts to guess how the Department would apply the regulations.\\nMSBA encourages the Department to review and revise the FERPA Regulations to provide more\\nspecific guidance to school districts on when pictures of students caught on video recordings may be\\nreleased. Because the U.S. Department of Education enforces FERPA, guidance directly from the\\nDepartment is necessary. In particular, MSBA encourages the Department to create guidance to\\naddress the following scenarios:\\nExample 1: Two students get into a fight, which is recorded on a bus or building security camera.\\nThe recording is used as a disciplinary record for both students and both students are disciplined.\\nThe parents of each student demand to see the recordings. The district does not have the technology\\nor expertise to obscure the faces of one student so that the parents of the other student may view the\\nrecor...</td>\n",

For that reason and many more, we urge the Department of\\nEducation to maintain the current level of data collection from all schools and\\ndistricts and to consider enhancing data collection so that parents and students\\nhave all the information they need to advocate for themselves.\\nThe Department is proposing to change the 2017-2018 CRDC to reduce\\nthe burden on school districts. However, the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions will only\\nshift the burden onto parents and students and actually result in increased\\nburdens for school staff.\\nMany parents and students attempt to gather data on their own, but\\nthey often have a difficult time navigating the records request and production\\nprocess. The CRDC provides families with an easily accessible method of\\ngathering information about schools in their communities. Diluting this tool\\nwill have the clear, predictable, and discriminatory consequence of harming\\nstudents and parents in low-income communities and communities of color.\\nFamilies currently have one easily accessible source to read information\\nabout the schools in their neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x94CRDC\\xe2\\x80\\x94but if data is taken off the\\nsite, families will have to find other sources of information. Families with more\\ntime and resources will be able to fill the information gap, but low-income\\nfamilies and communities of color will not. This unjust and discriminatory\\nresult should be prevented.\\nMoreover, the Department of Education should consider ways to\\nenhance the data available on CRDC so that families can make decisions that\\nare more informed. In particular, CRDC should collect and release more data:\\n1. For the LGBTQ community, English-Learners, foster youth, homeless\\nyouth, students with disabilities, and other students in our school system\\nthat may have unique needs.\\n2. On the impact of school security/police on students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 well-being and safety.\\n3. On the reasons why students are disciplined, with a particular focus on the\\nuse of willful defiance/disruption.\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c4. On the use of alternatives to exclusionary discipline, such as Restorative\\nJustice and Positive Behavior and Intervention Supports (PBIS).\\nThe Department of Education should also collect and release data on an\\nannual basis so that families have the most current data available to them.\\nData collection and review is also necessary for school staff to learn what\\nis going well in their schools, what is not, and what other schools they can\\ncontact to learn from. Thus, reducing the level of data collection for CRDC will\\nactually result in the opposite intended effect in the long-term\\xe2\\x80\\x94it will increase\\nthe burden on many schools because they will not have sufficient information\\nfor effective planning and problem-solving.\\nFor the aforementioned reasons, we urge the Department of Education\\nto maintain the current level of data collection and consider enhancing the Civil\\nRights Data Collection with the above-listed recommendations.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nRuth Cusick\\nSenior Staff Attorney\\n\\nAnabel Agloro\\nStaff Attorney\\n\\nOscar Daniel Lopez\\nStaff Attorney\\n\\n\\x0c'</td>\n",

This practice is required by the\\nAdministrative Procedure Act. It is also sensible policy. Department policies on Title IX\\naffect thousands of schools and millions of students, staff, and faculty. Ensuring public\\nparticipation and the airing of views is critical. If department statements are not binding,\\nbut merely tentative announcements of Department positions, then they ought not be\\ntreated as legal obligations by the agency during investigation or enforcement\\nproceedings. The law clearly requires this as well.\\n(2) During compliance investigations, Department staff should not coerce schools into\\nadopting policies and procedures that exceed any existing federal legal obligations. The\\nthreat of losing federal funds ought not be used to change primary behavior if it is not\\nrequired by existing statutes, regulations, or judicial interpretation.\\n(3) School policies and process should seek to protect the rights of complainants and\\naccused, irrespective of sex or gender.\\nIf I can provide any additional information, I would be delighted to do so.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJacob E.

Council Education Committee members are former students who received special\\neducation services, parents of students with disabilities, special education teachers, school\\nadministrators, staff from the Department of Education &amp; Early Development (EED) and others involved\\nin the education of students with disabilities. The Council Education Committee works on issues and\\nactivities of concern to make changes in the education system that improve the lives of students with\\ndisabilities.\\nOn June 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) published a Federal Register\\nnotice that it is seeking public input regarding regulations or guidance to be repealed, replaced or\\nmodified. The Department is particularly interested in regulatory provisions that members of the public\\nfind unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome. The Department also published the first progress\\nreport of its Regulatory Reform Task Force, which was formed pursuant to a February 2017 presidential\\nexecutive order requiring federal agencies to create such task forces to evaluate existing regulations for\\npotential repeal, replacement or modification. Comments in response to the Federal Register notice\\nmust be submitted no later than August 21, 2017.\\nIn the progress report, the task force identified more than 150 regulations and a total of 1,772 items of\\npolicy-related guidance to be reviewed. As a next step, the task force is requiring offices within the\\nDepartment, including the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), to recommend regulations to be\\nrepealed, replaced or modified. The task force also announced that it plans to meet with major\\nconstituencies and stakeholder groups, including some major higher education association groups to\\nseek their input. The task force further intends to facilitate discussions on these issues at conferences\\nand meetings.\\nThe Council Education Committee recognizes the value of cost containment and simplified regulations,\\nas a general goal. However, the IDEA regulations form a unified, comprehensive scheme with\\ninterdependent sections. Removing or modifying sections of these regulations in a piecemeal fashion\\nrisks causing unintended impacts to other related sections of the regulations, which could in turn\\nadversely affect the education of children with disabilities. Even small changes to the IDEA regulations\\nmay result in increased disputes and litigation between parents and school districts due to the impact of\\nthose changes. Initially, the IDEA regulations resulted in a large number of due process hearings across\\nthe country, as school districts and families sought clarification and correct application of the\\nregulations. As the rights of students and parents under the IDEA have become clarified, the number of\\ndue process hearings in most states has decreased significantly. The potential cost savings proposed by\\nnew changes to the regulations must be weighed against the possible expense of new disputes that may\\narise from altering rights that are currently settled under the existing regulations. The Council Education\\nCommittee cautions the Department to avoid piecemeal amendments to the IDEA regulations that could\\nresult in confusion about procedures and rights under the IDEA, increased due process hearings, and\\ndecreased educational opportunity for children with disabilities.\\n\\nPage 1 of 1\\n\\n\\x0c'</td>\n",

HCC is located in Columbia Maryland.  We enrolled 14,467 credit students in FY2016 and 15,571 noncredit continuing education students.  Almost a quarter of graduating seniors from Howard County high schools in 2016 enrolled at HCC in Fall 2016, and 42% of undergraduate students living in the county attend HCC.  The average age of our student is 26 years old and 37% of our students enroll fulltime.  Forty-eight percent (48%) of fall 2016 credit students received financial aid during their enrollment at HCC.   Seventy-one percent (71%) of our aid recipients are Pell Grant students.  Thirty percent (30%) of our aid recipients borrowed from the student loan programs, which is 10% of our enrolled students.\\n\\nWe concur with the comments submitted by the American Association of Community Colleges, and would like to emphasize a few of the points made by AACC in the comments below.\\n\\nProgram Integrity:  Gainful Employment Regulations\\n\\nWe are pleased that ED has already undertaken the process to reopen negotiated rulemaking proceedings to modify the gainful employment (GE) regulations.  We agree with the basic approach to create GE eligibility metrics for individual GE programs, which show whether students who complete GE programs are subsequently able to repay their student loans without undue burden in a reasonable time period. Our understanding is that the vast majority of community college GE programs were never in any danger of failing the debt-to-earnings metric (and none did).    Howard Community College has 27 GE programs, and only one program had earnings published (verified student count of 17 with median earnings  of $60,704 and mean earnings of $58,273) and no programs had a sufficient number of borrowers for a debt to earnings ratio to be published.   The cost of implementing the GE regulations is enormous, involving staff across many academic and administrative office, and there was no benefit to our students.\\n\\nWe recommend that the GE regulations should exempt institutions and/or programs that have a history of low borrowing. Most community colleges have well below 50% of their students borrowing federal loans.   Only about 10% of HCC's enrolled students borrow from the loan program, and even far less than that percentage of students who are enrolled specifically in the GE programs.    Therefore we recommend that our GE programs should be exempted from the current GE reporting regulations and any new GE regulations, other than some basic program disclosures referred to below. \\n\\nAdditionally, we agree with AACC's recommendation that a minimum threshold be set for the number of Title IV students enrolled in the program in order to require reporting on GE programs to align with confidentiality and other rules. This includes almost all of HCC's GE programs.\\n\\nReturn of Title IV Funds:  \\n\\nThese regulations are the most complex of the Title IV regulations and they are the most difficult to implement in a community college.  The complexity of these regulations basically requires that these calculations be done manually.   The complexity is not in the math, but in the gathering of the correct enrollment data for the calculation.   The reason why this area remains one of the top 3 findings in program reviews and audits for the past decade is not because colleges do not put the time and effort into complying, it's because it's too complex to automate and too complex to be able to reliably do a manual calculation for hundreds of students each term.   HCC has surveyed other community colleges and on average, it takes about 30 minutes per withdrawn student to complete the r2t4 calculation process from start to finish.   The ACE report proposes modifications to several provisions of these regulations to ease the burden of compliance. \\n\\nVerification and ISIR Comment Codes: \\n\\nIt's the highest need students, Pell eligible applicants, who are most subject to having to gather additional documentation to validate the information they submitted on the FAFSA.   This occurs as a part of the verification process and also through various comment codes assigned by the U.S. Department of Education on the ISIR.Simplifying the FAFSA but increasing the complexity of the documentation required to complete the file does not improve access for high need students.   We recommend that the simplification approach be also applied on the \"back end\" to make it easier for students to complete their financial aid file.   One critical issue that we hope doesn't occur again is the shutdown of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA. \\n\\nThank you for your consideration of these comments.

SSWAA promotes the profession of school social work to enhance social-emotional\\ngrowth and positive mental health, behavioral, and academic outcomes of all students. We support school\\nsocial work as a valued, integral part of the education of all children, connecting schools, families and\\ncommunities.\\nSchool social workers are conversant with and work under most federal laws governing elementary and\\nsecondary education. We are particularly interested in regulations implementing the Individuals with\\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). We focus on the impact\\nof the laws and accompanying regulations on students' ability to access and receive school-based mental\\nhealth services from qualified school-employed mental health professionals, including school social\\nworkers, to ensure academic success for all students. We also work through those laws to ensure a\\npositive school learning environment for all students.\\nGenerally seen as a civil rights statute, the IDEA ensures a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in\\nthe least restrictive environment (LRE) for all eligible children and youth with disabilities. It is a complex\\neducation law, and the accompanying regulations are comprehensive and closely aligned with the\\nstatutory language. The law gives families the right to participate in the development of an individualized\\neducation program (IEP) and due process rights to enforce FAPE, LRE, and other critical provisions of\\nthe law. Strong implementation of the IDEA, based on both the statute and the regulations, has been\\ncritical in helping students with disabilities, including those with mental health needs, advance\\nacademically and in providing their families full partnership in educational decisions for their children.\\nA broad array of stakeholders provided extensive comments to and engaged intensively with the\\nDepartment of Education on the current IDEA regulations. The Department issued regulations that mirror\\nthe law in many instances and clarify certain statutory provisions to assist school districts in implementing\\nthe law fairly and appropriately. These regulations also help families understand what services and\\n\\nTel/Fax: 202.686.1637 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 www.sswaa.org\\n\\n\\x0csupports are available to their children and how they can be accessed. SSWAA believes any changes to\\nthese regulations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 repeal, replacement, or modification \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should not be undertaken without considering\\nthe full context of the law. Therefore, SSWAA does not support changing current IDEA regulations in any\\nmanner at this time.\\nIn addition, school social workers are part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) as school-based\\nmental health providers, working closely with the four designated student subgroups and their families.\\nWe have already seen the repeal of accountability regulations promulgated shortly after the law was\\npassed before these regulations were allowed to go into effect. School districts need clarity and stability\\nas they move forward to implement this new law fully in the next school year. Any further changes at this\\ntime will affect longstanding plans by states to effectively transition to ESSA. Therefore, SSWAA\\nrecommends no further changes to ESSA regulations at this time.\\nSSWAA would be pleased to serve as a resource to the Department regarding issues related to school\\nmental health and positive school climate. As you move forward, please feel free to contact Myrna\\nMandlawitz, SSWAA Director of Government Relations, mrmassociates@verizon.net, to assist you with\\nthis and other Department activities.\\nThank you for your careful consideration of these comments.\\nSincerely,\\nRebecca Oliver\\nExecutive Director\\n\\nTel/Fax: 202.686.1637 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 www.sswaa.org\\n\\n\\x0c\"</td>\n",

DSS/RSB is requesting the USDOE review and\\nconsider revisions to two regulations to provide States with the opportunity and maximum flexibility to\\ndevelop and provide innovative services to the blind citizens of Missouri and other states.\\n1.\\n\\nHomemaker Exemption \\xe2\\x80\\x94 34 CFR \\xc2\\xa7361.5(c)(15)\\nThe DSS/RSB urges the USDOE to revise 34 CFR \\xc2\\xa7361.5(c)(15) and other relevant\\nregulations implementing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to\\nreinstate the Homemaker Outcome to qualify for Vocational Rehabilitation services.\\nBefore WIOA, blind and visually impaired individuals could qualify for Vocational\\nRehabilitation (VR) services, including independent living training as home makers. The\\nUSDOE exercised its discretion and recognized the value of homemakers by regarding it a\\nRELAY MISSOURI\\nFOR HEARING AND SPEECH IMPAIRED\\n\\n1-800-735-2466 VOICE \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1-800-735-2966 TEXT PHONE\\nAn Equal Oppomomy Employer, services provided on a nomhscrimmoony hams.\\n\\n\\x0cAugust 22. 2017\\nPage 2\\n\\nsuccessful \"employment outcome\" under \\xc2\\xa7361.5(c)(15) even though homemakers were\\nnot being paid a direct wage. This outcome is consistent with the discretion that the\\nSecretary has to establish and define appropriate employment outcomes.\\'\\nThe Homemaker Outcome had been considered a successful closure for the use of federal\\nVR funds for many years. It not only allows the individual to become personally and\\neconomically self-sufficient, it recognizes the critical role that homemakers fulfill in the\\nlocal and national economy. This is particularly important for individuals who are blind or\\nvisually impaired. Individuals who are blind rely on DSU\\'s/VR programs as a pathway\\ntowards achieving and/or regaining independence and economic self-sufficiency. Blind,\\nnewly blind and visually impaired individuals need to learn and master many skills that are\\nessential to success in the home and the workplace. They must master braille and/or other\\ninformation technology to access communication. They must learn and/or relearn basic\\nliving skills such as cooking, cleaning and home management. They must study and master\\nthe skills necessary to know where they are, how to get from place to place and how to\\nfunction in a home and work environment. A critical first step in achieving this goal is to\\nprovide VR training and support to enable the individual to effectively manage their home.\\nAchieving this level of self-sufficiency enables the individual to use those skills as a jumping\\noff point into the competitive labor market. Individuals are required to be served in\\nIndependent Living or Independent Living Older Blind programs with no increase in\\nprogram funding to support the additional clients and level of services offered under the\\nVR program. Many working age individuals do not qualify for independent living services\\nunder the Older Individuals with Blindness Program.2 Therefore, denying blind and visually\\nimpaired individuals of the opportunity to learn these skills deprives them of the\\nopportunity to build the foundation for success and self-sufficiency upon which success in\\na competitive workplace is based.\\n2.\\n\\nCompetitive Integrative Employment Regulation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 34 CFR \\xc2\\xa7 361.5(c)(9)\\nDSS/RSB urges the USDOE to review the Competitive Integrative Employment regulation to\\ngive states who support blind and visually impaired individuals the flexibility to implement\\na wide range of training and employment opportunities through VR program.

We work to improve public education by\\nstrengthening charter authorizing policies and practices.\\nThe charter school model is built on the premise that strong student outcomes are possible when\\nschools are granted increased autonomy over a range of operational and programmatic areas and, in\\nexchange, are subject to strong accountability. It is an authorizer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsibility to uphold this charter\\nbargain.\\nIn response to this Request for Comment, NACSA reviewed federal regulations and guidance documents\\nto identify policy areas that would benefit from re-examination. As you know, charter schools, just like all\\npublic schools, are subject to federal laws, regulations, and Department guidance. The majority of laws\\nand regulations apply to charter schools in exactly the same way as traditional public schools, while\\nsome regulations may apply slightly differently. A handful apply only to charter schools that receive\\nfederal Charter School Program grant funds. With this in mind we focused our review on regulations and\\nguidance that: (1) apply only to charter schools; (2) have an outsized impact on charter schools; and/or\\n(3) affect the ability of charter school authorizers to perform necessary oversight functions.\\nThe resulting comments, detailed on the following pages, are categorized by authorizing program and\\ninclude recommendations and our rationale for review. In some cases, we are encouraging the\\nDepartment to retain regulations or guidance that help authorizers perform necessary oversight\\nfunctions or protect charter schools from state or district overreach. We also plan to submit additional\\ndetailed comments pertaining to the non-regulatory guidance governing the Charter School Program in\\na separate letter.\\nThank you for your consideration. We look forward to continuing our work with the Department of\\nEducation and Congress to advance our shared goals. Please feel free to contact Amanda Fenton at\\namandaf@qualitycharters.org with any questions.\\nRegards,\\n\\nGreg Richmond\\nPresident &amp; CEO\\n\\nALL CHILDREN DESERVE A QUALITY EDUCATION.\\n\\n\\x0cRegulations and Guidance applying to the Charter\\nSchools Program\\nHelp Legacy Grantees Make Use of New Program Flexibilities\\nRelevant Citations:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\nNCLB Sec. 5202(d)(1)\\nNCLB Sec. 5204(f)(3)\\nNCLB Sec. 5204(f)(4)\\nCharter Schools Program, Title V, Part B of the ESEA Nonregulatory Guidance (issued January,\\n2014)\\n\\nDescription:\\nThe Charter School Program State Educational Agencies grant (CSP SEA) was eliminated and reimagined as the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools State Entity (State Entity) grant\\nprogram through the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). As a result, the CSP SEA grants exist only as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clegacy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grant program, administering funds to SEAs awarded grants in FY16 or earlier according to\\nprevious CSP SEA grant regulations and guidance. This cohort of legacy grantees includes more than a\\ndozen states that combined have charter sectors that serve more than two thirds of all charter school\\nstudents in the country. The impacted states have a long history of success growing high quality charter\\nschools, with ten of the impacted states recipients of back-to-back CSP grants for over eleven year.\\nWhen Congress re-imagined the CSP SEA program as the State Entity grant program through ESSA it\\nsignificantly improved many of the laws governing the program by increasing flexibility for state grantees\\nand for individual charter schools across several program areas. Under the new program states have\\nmuch more flexibility to expend funds to grow innovative, successful charter schools and to engage in\\nactivities that improve the performance of all charter schools across the state.\\nUnfortunately, under current Department policy, legacy grantees under the old program enjoy few of\\nthese benefits. Instead they are faced with a quixotic choice: go through the burdensome and\\nunpromising task of petitioning the Department for multiple individual program waivers to pursue\\nactivities that are already allowed for new grantees; or submit a separate application for a new grant\\nunder the State Entity program...</td>\n",

The U.S. Department of Education (ED) in the\\nnotice stated it was seeking input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement,\\nor modification. This is an extremely broad request and the very nature of it necessitated our\\ncomment on critical protections that we feel need to be maintained. Moreover, we request\\nfurther opportunity to provide comments to the extent to which ED is considering repealing or\\nmodifying any particular regulation.\\nIn general, Wisconsin strongly encourages ED to maintain regulations and guidance to support\\naccess and funding to public education, and to ensure each student graduates college and career\\nready. With that said, much of the rest of these comments will focus on the importance of the\\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and its accompanying regulations and\\nguidance materials.\\nIt is important to remind ourselves that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was\\noriginally enacted in 1975. It was then known as the Education for All Handicapped Children\\nAct. Prior to the enactment of this law, many children with disabilities were denied a public\\neducation and the opportunity to attend schools with their nondisabled peers. IDEA was enacted\\nso that all students with disabilities ages three through 21 are entitled to receive a free\\nappropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment through the\\ndevelopment of an individualized education program (IEP) designed to address the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndisability-related educational needs. The IDEA regulations also specify planning services and\\nsupports designed to specifically prepare the student for further education and competitive\\nemployment. Thus, IDEA not only provides students with disabilities access to education with\\ntheir peers, but helps prepares them for postsecondary success. The accompanying regulations to\\nthis law provide a level of specificity needed to ensure that state educational agencies, school\\ndistricts, and families have the assistance, mechanisms, and safeguards needed to effectively\\n\\nPO Box 7841, Madison, WI 53707-7841 \\xef\\x81\\xae 125 South Webster Street, Madison, WI 53703\\n(608) 266-3390 \\xef\\x81\\xae (800) 441-4563 toll free \\xef\\x81\\xae dpi.wi.gov\\n\\n\\x0cHilary Malawer\\nPage 2\\nAugust 22, 2017\\nenforce and implement this law. The regulations are vital in ensuring these opportunities for our\\nstudents with disabilities are not reduced.\\nIn addition, the Dear Colleague letters issued by the Office of Special Education Programs\\n(OSEP), provides clarification of IDEA requirements and supports our work as a state\\neducational agency and the work of our districts and other stakeholders. For example, the Dear\\nColleague Letter, dated November 16, 2015, directly supports our work around improving\\noutcomes for students with disability through the College and Career Ready (CCR) IEP\\nframework. The November 16 Dear Colleague letter emphasizes that a student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IEP must be\\ndeveloped with high expectations and that annual goals must be both ambitious and achievable\\nand aligned with rigorous grade-level content standards. This forms the basis for our CCR IEP\\nframework, which is designed to enrich IEP team discussion leading to the development of both\\ncompliant and results-driven IEPs. CCR IEPs build knowledge, skills, and habits throughout a\\nstudent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic experiences, so when they graduate, they are college and career ready. WDPI\\nhas revised its model IEPs as well as its monitoring system to align with this framework.\\nLikewise, the Dear Colleague letter issued on August 1, 2016 clarifies that as part of providing\\nFAPE to a student with a disability, the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavioral needs must be addressed through\\npositive supports, strategies, and interventions, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat incidents of child misbehavior or\\nclassroom disruptions, as well as violations of a code of student conduct, may indicate that the\\nstudent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IEP needs to include appropriate behavioral supports.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d WDPI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Positive Behavioral\\nIntervention and Supports system, as well as its guidance on functional behavioral assessments\\nand the development of behavioral intervention plans, are both supported by and strengthened by\\nthis Dear Colleague letter.\\nWhile all of th...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer:\\n\\nI am submitting comment on the proposed evaluation of the Department of Education (DEd)'s existing regulations, particularly\\nthose related to the implementation of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA), dates August 19, 2016. We \\nunderstand that comments are being received as it relates to repealing, adjusting and/or changing the rulemaking related to \\nthe Javits Wagner O'Day Act under what is known as AbilityOne, and the treatment of those opportunities as not \"competitive\\nand integrated\" for the purposes of WIOA. Our comments support maintaining the current regulations as they exist, in \\nparticular, as they relate to the treatment of AbilityOne programs as being defined as not \"competitive and integrated\" for \\nthe purposes of WIOA.\\n\\nAbilityOne, the brand name for the implementation of the Javits Wagner O'Day Act (JWOD), passed in 1938, and refreshed \\nin 1971, is charged with providing training and employment opportunities to people who are blind or severely disabled. The \\nprogram effectively merged (as was the purpose of such Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) programs) the training with \\nemployment for people with disabilities. The passage of WIOA and subsequent rulemaking provided an opportunity to \\nbifurcate the two functions, particularly for those providing employment and training to people with disabilities.\\n\\nIt is my contention that the WIOA rulemaking as it relates to sheltered workshops, of which JWOD is, marks the \\nculmination of a long progression of civil rights development to shift from segregation of people with disabilities in the \\nemployment realm. WIOA will ensure that a managerial shift of those organizations currently operating under JWOD \\nwill have to synthesize with the new regulations and will simply be formalizing what is already occurring in the disability \\nemployment and training community. Moreover, many advocates for people with disabilities see sheltered workshops as \\nlimiting for those who are employed in them, particularly where direct labor requirements are employed.\\n\\nAbilityOne nonprofits are one of the largest employers of people with disabilities in the nation, and the federal \\ngovernment's paradoxical position on the matter is one which must be reconciled. However, such a reconciliation \\nis for participants in the program to synthesize, and options are available AbilityOne nonprofits to become \\nCompetitive and Integrated under the WIOA law. A solution has been presented to Congress and the Section 809\\npanel in the form of a White Paper (attached below). Fundamentally, the DEd got the regulations correct. Pushing \\nAbilityOne to have to adjust to the modern work environment, and examining how JWOD fits the modern economy, \\nis an essential part of the regulations. The intent is to mainstream Competitive and Integrated opportunities and I \\nstrongly believe the WIOA regulations are the right direction to meet that objective. Alternatively, maintaining the \\nstatus quo will be a huge step back from the Competitive and Integrated push for people with disabilities. Please \\nsee the attached White Paper for further detail on the role WIOA and JWOD could play with ensuring \\nCompetitive and Integrated opportunities for those with disabilities. \\n</td>\n",

Lincoln Avenue\\nAltadena, CA 91001\\nTel: 626-344-7056\\nwww.sachsmanagement.com\\nssachs@sachsmanagement.com\\n\\nAugust 2017\\n\\n\\x0cPage: 1\\n\\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\\nAbilityOne (AB1) is the brand name of the program authorized by the Javits, Wagner,\\nO\\xe2\\x80\\x99Day (JWOD) Act, which was originally passed in 1938 and refreshed in 1971. The\\nintent of JWOD was to authorize a special preference in government contracting for\\nnonprofit sheltered workshops that train and employ people with disabilities. Nonprofits\\nmaintain their status in the program and the highest priority in federal contracting if they\\nprovide 75% of the direct labor on the products or services contracted for with people\\nwith disabilities. The program is broken into two sections- SourceAmerica (formerly the\\nNational Industries of Severely Handicapped), and the National Industries for the Blind\\nor (NIB) affiliates. Within the program, there are preferences for people who are blind for\\nsupplying products to the federal government, but that preference is second to the\\nFederal Prison Industries (FPI) (see FAR Part 8.6 and FAR Part 8.7 generally).\\nOnce a requirement is identified by AbilityOne for supply to the federal government, the\\nCentral Nonprofit Agencies (CNA) consisting of NIB and SourceAmerica, will work with\\nthe AbilityOne Commission (Commission) (formerly the Committee for the Purchase of\\nFrom People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled), to add the requirement to the\\nProcurement List. Following Administrative Procedure Act (APA) direction, a\\nrequirement is assessed for \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuitability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in accordance with the authorizing statutes by\\nthe Commission. The Commission has extraordinary discretion to determine the\\nsatisfaction of those suitability requirements (for instance no rule making has been done\\nto determine what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadverse impact on the incumbent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means, rather, it is a rule of\\nthumb determination by the Commission). Once the suitability is determined, the\\nCommission publishes its intent to add a requirement to the Procurement List in the\\nFederal Register. Upon the conclusion of the comment period, the Commission will\\nevaluate the comments, record of information from the affiliated CNA and nonprofit to\\ndetermine suitability. If suitability is deemed proper, the requirement is added to the\\nProcurement List. Thereafter, government buyers \\xe2\\x80\\x8bmust purchase items from the\\nProcurement List before using any other means of purchasing.\\nThe AB1 program has grown and changed significantly over the years. Currently,\\ngovernment customers spend over $3 billion to purchase products and services\\nprovided by nonprofits affiliated with NIB and SourceAmerica (based on the FY 2015\\nreport by the Commission, the last document recording overall program sales) making\\nthe program the largest employer of people with disabilities in the nation. Moreover, for\\nthe privilege of participating in the program, those nonprofits must pay a fee of just\\nunder 4% for all contract revenue to NIB and SourceAmerica (about $130 million\\nannually) for program \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmanagement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on behalf of the Commission.\\n\\n\\x0cPage: 2\\n\\nPrices charged to government customers are set by the Commission which is the\\nultimate arbiter of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prices, though in many cases, those prices are\\nsignificantly higher than otherwise found in the commercial marketplace. Justifying the\\nhigher prices, AB1 nonprofits claim the need to use disabled labor (more on that later),\\nwhich requires higher management and more oversight than commercial organizations\\nand with less productivity (one of the reasons AB1 nonprofits have used sub-minimum\\nwage labor as well due to productivity reductions).1\\nThe largest customer of AbilityOne nonprofits by far is the Department of Defense\\n(DOD). Reform for the program, which is in need of greater oversight, would be best\\nserved coming from the DOD and it is the intent of this paper to highlight many of the\\nissues with the program and how these issues can be addressed in a way that will not\\nharm those served by these programs. Rather, DOD can increase Competitive and\\nIntegrated (CI) opportunities for those in the program, and ultimately, increase\\ncompetition in a changing budget environment, allowing the DOD greater flexibility in\\nsourcing and how it meets its mission. It is obvious that if the reforms begin at DOD, the\\nsame benefits can be applied across the entire Federal Government which is required\\nto purchase items under JWOD with the same priorities afforded DOD customers.2\\nThe purpose of this document is to assist all stakeholders in meeting the changing\\nneeds of the program thro...</td>\n",

In 2016 the P&amp;As worked on nearly 14,000 individual cases related to\\nenforcing the civil rights of students with disabilities and the CAP agencies worked on\\nnearly 18,000 cases, including information and referral, related to vocational\\nrehabilitation.

The\\nCouncil of Administrators of Special Education (CASE) is an international professional educational\\norganization affiliated with the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) whose members are dedicated\\nto the enhancement of the worth, dignity, potential, and uniqueness of each individual in society.\\nCASE represents special education administrators in local school districts, the individuals charged with\\nresponsibility for implementation and financial oversight of special education programs for children\\nand youth with disabilities in schools across the country.\\nCASE is dedicated to high quality implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA).\\nIDEA is a comprehensive and complex law bolstered by regulations which are highly aligned with the\\nstatute. While CASE has specific areas of interest in recommending changes and improvements to\\nIDEA and the associated regulations, it is not appropriate or helpful to consider singular regulations for\\nrevision or reduction without considering the full context of the law. It is for these reasons that CASE\\ndoes not support any one regulation be altered or reduced at this time, but instead supports waiting\\nuntil reauthorization of the full law takes place to recommend these alterations.\\nIDEA serves an incredibly important role in supporting school and district leaders in ensuring high\\nquality and inclusive educational opportunities for students with disabilities. As leaders in the field of\\nspecial education we are highly sensitive to the interrelationship between each section of the law and\\nthe regulations that flow from it. There are several regulations under IDEA that have required\\nsignificant amounts of time to understand and implement. Recent regulations around significant\\ndisproportionality are a good example where implementation is presently just getting underway.\\n\\n\\x0cCASE \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x93 Regulatory Reform\\nPage 2\\nWhile we understand the need to discuss efficiencies, effectiveness is of utmost importance in these\\ndiscussions. Reducing regulations will result in decreased efficiencies, creating greater complexity\\nand confusion if one or two regulations are changed without a full review of the law itself. CASE\\nsupports maintaining the IDEA regulations as currently written. Changes in regulation should not be\\npiecemeal and instead should be considered very carefully in the context of reauthorization.\\nThank you for the opportunity to provide input regarding the request for comments on the status of\\ncurrent education regulations. CASE would be happy to engage in further discussions and serve as a\\nresource on the IDEA. For further information, please contact Dr. Luann Purcell, CASE Executive\\nDirector, lpurcell@casecec.org.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDr. Luann Purcell\\nExecutive Director\\n\\n\\x0c'</td>\n",

This initial set of regulatory\\ncomments on the Every Student Succeeds Act\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (ESSA) final assessment regulations were\\npreviously submitted to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) based on a\\nMay 31 request for comments. Additionally, the Council now has included a few other\\ncomments on the June 30 IDEA final regulations (34 CFR 300) that replicate a number of the\\nESSA assessment regulations and appear to incorporate others by reference, specifically the\\noverly expansive ESSA translation regulations and the unauthorized ESSA regulatory\\nrequirement that every State establish a definition of students with the most significant\\ncognitive disabilities. These two additional comments can be found on pages 4 and 6 and are\\nnoted with an asterisk (*).\\nThe Council notes that many of the proposed ESSA rules developed by the Negotiated\\nRulemaking Committee have little or no basis in the Act and have now been incorporated by\\nreference into the IDEA final regulations. The result is unnecessary and unwarranted federal\\nrequirements for the development and implementation of ESSA-related assessments, as well as\\nin other areas not directly related to assessments. The Council requests that the Education\\nDepartment exercise the leadership and direction that were lacking during Negotiated\\nRulemaking, and revise the assessment regulations in direct conformity with the provisions of\\nthe Act.\\nMoreover, the Council disputes any thought that the final ESSA assessment regulations from\\nDecember 8, 2016 cannot be revised without reconvening a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee.\\nFirst, it is specious to assume that subsequent administrations could not undertake notice and\\ncomment rulemaking on any set of final regulations, particularly when it took some 14 years to\\ncomplete the last ESEA reauthorization. Second, the 2015 Neg Reg process appears to satisfy\\nthe ESSA section 1601 requirement for assessment regulations. And finally, the Secretary\\nretains clear statutory authority in section 1601(c) to determine that Neg Reg is unnecessary, or\\nthe Secretary could determine under section 1601(c)(3) that there is an emergency need to have\\nrevised assessment regulations prior to the spring 2018 state testing period.\\nThe following comments by the Council of the Great City Schools recommend revisions to the\\nESSA and IDEA assessment regulations, including the unauthorized requirement on the use of\\nthe ESSA 8th grade advanced math testing flexibility provision; the overregulation of provisions\\nrelated to alternative assessments and state waiver conditions; and several other overly\\nexpansive assessment regulations.\\n\\n\\x0cCouncil of the Great City Schools\\nComments on Existing Education Department Regulations\\nPage 2\\n\\nUnauthorized Regulatory Requirements to Utilize the 8th Grade Advanced\\nMath Testing Flexibility Provision under ESSA sec. 1111(b)(2)(C).\\nTo prevent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble testing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ESSA allows an 8th grade student enrolled in advanced math classes\\nto take a higher-level math assessment without being required also to take the regular 8th grade\\nstatewide math assessment. The assessment regulations [34 CFR 200.5(b)(4)], however, convert\\nthis narrow flexibility provision designed to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble testing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into a federal mandate for\\nstatewide strategies \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto provide all students in the State with the opportunity to be prepared for\\nand to take advanced mathematics coursework in middle school\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (emphasis added). In effect,\\nthis regulatory provision, drafted by the Department during negotiated rulemaking, imposes\\nmandatory State-level policies to provide any middle school student universal access to\\nprerequisite middle school advanced math coursework and to the advanced 8th grade math\\nassessment--if the State opts to use this ESSA flexibility. This rule regulates statewide\\ninstructional course offerings, in contrast to the ESSA statute, which solely addresses a math\\nassessment option. The regulation far exceeds the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble testing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d flexibility specified in the\\nAct, and propels the U.S. Department of Education into the arena of requiring additional State\\ninstructional coursework. Moreover, it is entirely unclear whether the requirement on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadvanced\\nmathematics coursework in middle school\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would apply to Algebra 1...</td>\n",

The vast majority of our individual members are campus officials with direct responsibility for\\nadmissions, recruiting, academic records, and registration functions. Because they serve as custodians of\\neducation records for current and former students, our members are particularly knowledgeable about privacy\\nissues in general, and specifically about information security and privacy requirements of Federal and State\\nlaws. Compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) has long been a primary area\\nof professional jurisdiction for AACRAO members, who are often the leading FERPA experts on their\\ncampuses.\\nSince its original enactment in 1974, and through the numerous amendments, court decisions, and administrative\\npolicy revisions that have further refined that original construct over the years, AACRAO has been\\nconstructively engaged with the Department of Education to promote FERPA compliance and achieve the right\\nbalance between individual educational privacy rights and the rights of third-parties to obtain access to data for\\nappropriate purposes.\\n2012 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Regulations\\nIn 2012, the Obama Administration, through the Department, implemented regulatory amendments that\\ndramatically expanded FERPA. (The amended regulations were published in the Federal Register on December\\n2, 2011, but became effective on January 3, 2012.) The amendments greatly broadened the definition of who is\\ngiven access to personally identifiable information (PII) from student records on a non-consensual basis.\\nAACRAO believes that some of the 2012 regulatory changes are unnecessary and run counter to legislative\\nintent and plain language of the law. Additionally, most of the provisions that were adopted actually require\\nlegislative amendments to FERPA, and the Department lacks legal authority to implement them through\\nregulatory action. The association strongly urges that the following 2012 regulatory amendments to FERPA be\\nrescinded.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nThe Term \"Authorized Representative\" (\\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa799.3, 99.35)\\nAACRAO strongly supports the narrowing of the definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized representative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to individuals and\\nentities under the direct control of officials designated in the statute as entitled to non-consensual access to\\npersonally identifiable information from education records. While the term was not defined in previous versions\\nof the FERPA regulations, the common (and correct) understanding of this term was reflected in a January 30,\\n2003, memorandum issued by then-Deputy Secretary of Education, William D. Hansen. The memo explained\\nthat an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized representative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must be a party under the direct control of that authority, such as an\\nemployee or contractor, which the Hansen memo stated, was based on the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding of the\\nFERPA statute and Congressional statements as to its meaning. The 2012 regulatory changes inappropriately\\nexpanded this definition to anyone chosen by the designated officials.\\nPrior to the 2012 amendments, Section (b)(1) of FERPA conditioned receipt of any Department funds to any\\neducational agency or institution not having a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records\\n(or personally identifiable information (PII) other than directory information) of students without first obtaining\\nwritten consent, except under very specific circumstances. One exception to this requirement is for release of\\neducation records to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized representatives\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Secretary,\\nState educational authorities, or (for law enforcement purposes) the Attorney General. 20...</td>\n",

Headquartered in New Britain, CT, we employ over 1,000 individuals with significant disabilities in meaningful and well-paying jobs throughout the country, many of whom are employed at military bases and prestigious government facilities as a direct result of the AbilityOne program.  \\nOur comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations and guidance are stripping away the rights of people with disabilities by closing off meaningful and well-paying jobs for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \\nIn the absence of the AbilityOne program, many of the individuals we serve would not be employed or would be working in lower paying positions with minimal to no benefits.

These regulations\\nand guidance are stripping away the rights of people with disabilities by closing off meaningful and wellpaying jobs for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately\\ndisqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their\\nparticipation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program.\\nIn the absence of the AbilityOne program, many of the individuals we serve would not be employed or\\nwould be working in lower paying positions with minimal to no benefits. The unemployment rate for\\npeople with disabilities continues to be high, despite good intentions and various policies designed to\\nincrease employment.

We have a son with a rare syndrome called Pallister Killian Syndrome. He is 1 of 2 in the state of MN to have this. Our son has severe medical issues along with deaf/blindness. We live in the greater Minnesota region, so we do not have access to some of the schools where they have supports for this type of student. We have spent the last 9 years trying to educate our schools on how they can help our son. We knew early on about Interveners and had them in our home setting where we witnessed their profound impact on communication and connecting with our son. They have helped us gain tools to connect with our son when we didn't think it was possible. This has been transformational in a very unique situation that empowered us as a family to do all we could to help him understand his world around him. It wasn't until we had gone to mediation with the school due to differences in what they thought our son needed in the education system, where they finally brought in some Deaf/Blind Professionals who helped point out where his education was lacking. Mostly it was communication. Our son was 11 years old at this point and still didn't have a formal communication plan in school. If you can only imagine not hearing, not seeing and not connecting with your world for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week with people who did not understand you. I beg of you to push for this wording. We are a very small group but our kids CAN learn. They deserve a voice and to be heard. They just need a different way of doing so. With this regulation added to the list of related services, our children will have a chance to a meaningful education. This will save so much unnecessary grief for both the family and school system, but mostly, it will provide the student with an education that is appropriate for their disability of access.

IDEA and these regulations are critical to continuing the progress made over the last 30 years to ensure young children with or at risk for disabilities and their families receive the services they need to reach their full potential. The Division for Early Childhood (DEC) of the Council for Exceptional Children is the largest membership organization focused solely on the development and education of young children (ages birth8) with or at risk for disabilities and other special needs and their families. As such, DEC sees no need for repeal, replacement or modification of any IDEA regulations at this time and notes that changes to regulations are better addressed in the context of a reauthorization.  The current process is outside of the usual order, and as a result, is likely to lack the in-depth stakeholder input and public discussion critical to the success of such an activity.   \\n\\nIDEA and its implementing regulations are designed to address both access to early intervention and special education for children with disabilities, as well as the quality of those services. IDEA Parts A, B and C, outline the rights, responsibilities and infrastructures to ensure access to early intervention and education for eligible children and their families. In Part D, IDEA provides for investments in the quality of those services and infrastructures. Part D provides funding for parent support and information centers and the demonstration and dissemination of evidence-based, effective practices.\\n\\nThere is no doubt in the field of education and in the experiences of families, that IDEA is a success. Certainly, there are challenges in implementing such a broad and visionary policy and federal action can indeed assist in these efforts. But the answer to these challenges is not to revise or reduce IDEA regulations.  Quite the contrary, these regulations support efforts to implement IDEA successfully.  Fully funding IDEA federally would go a long way to addressing the challenges states and communities are facing.  \\n\\nIDEA has a federal infrastructure that implementation science tells us is necessary for the installation of effective practices. This infrastructure includes guidance from OSEP in best practice, accountability, and monitoring. For the early childhood provisions of IDEA (Part C and Section 619 of Part B), OSEP provides policy guidance as needed to state leaders to assist in their efforts to help local early intervention programs and school districts implement effective policies, practices and accountability measures while also holding them accountable to indicators of compliance and quality. \\n\\nIDEA early childhood programs also serve as a key mechanism of supports and services for young children with disabilities in community settings such as preschool, Head Start, Home Visiting and child care/early learning.  DEC appreciates the valuable policy guidance that has been released in the last several years through collaboration across federal programs in the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services as well as other federal agencies as needed.  This federal collaborative work has resulted in the release of a number of powerful policy statements from the respective Secretaries to assist local programs serving young children in understanding best practice giving all young children opportunities to succeed and be ready for school. DEC requests that the Department continue these efforts.  State and community leaders speak very highly of these policy statements and express how their use has helped further efforts for young children and families at the community level.  Examples of these policy statements include, but are not limited to, high quality inclusion, reducing and eliminating suspension and expulsion, and strengthening partnerships with families. \\n\\nDECs membership, representing all states, includes a diverse population of teachers, related service personnel, administrators, families, higher education faculty, and researchers. \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this important matter. DEC is available and willing to provide any additional information that may be needed.

       "2406   As a lawyer who once practiced education and civil-rights law, I request that the Education Department rescind the definition of \"significant disproportionality\" in 34 C.F.R.  300.647, and adopt a definition that is less onerous for local education agencies. As I explain in my attached comments, the current definition places pressure on them to adopt veiled racial quotas in special education services, which violates the Constitution.\\n\\nThe definition comes from the Obama administration's December 19, 2016 rule dealing with grants and assistance under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) governing the Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities program and the Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities program. See Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Assistance to States for the Education of Children With Disabilities; Preschool Grants for Children With Disabilities, 81 Fed. Reg. 92376 (Dec. 19, 2016). \\n \\nThe rule, now found at 34 C.F.R.  300.646 & 300.647, is problematic, because the rule will pressure school districts to violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal-protection clause through its definition of \"significant disproportionality.\" See 34 C.F.R.  300.647 (interpreting 20 U.S.C.  1418(d)(1)'s reference to \"significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity\"); 34 C.F.R. 300.647(a)(1)&(a)(6) (defining disproportionality in terms of comparisons between \"one racial or ethnic group\" and \"all other racial and ethnic groups\").  \\n \\nThe notice containing the final version of the rule ignored the agency's duty to interpret laws so as to avoid potential constitutional problems. The rule interprets \"significant disproportionality\" as being based on a crude comparison of the number of minorities versus number of whites with a particular outcome or classification - rather than whether the outcome or classification was more accurate for members of one race rather than another due to disproportionate failure to evaluate members of a particular race correctly. The rule compares the \"outcome for children in one racial or ethnic group\" not with the correct outcome, but with the \"outcome for children in all other racial or ethnic groups.\" See 34 C.F.R.  300.647(a)(1)&(a)(6). \\n\\nThere was a plausible alternative interpretation of \"significant disproportionality\" that did not raise any potential constitutional problem (one focusing on skewed process rather than outcome, such as whether economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to appropriate identification or placement skewed the process against a minority group). \\n\\nSo there was no reason to adopt the interpretation contained in the rule, which punishes LEA's for not achieving a racial quota in identification of children as disabled. If regulated entities do not achieve \"significant disproportionality,\" even for reasons beyond their control, 15% of their funds are diverted to coordinated, early intervening services. See 34 CFR  300.647(d)&(e).\\n \\nRacial-balance requirements in special education are unconstitutional. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 538 (7th Cir. 1997) (overturning provision in court \"decree\" that \"limits minority enrollment in compensatory education (that is, remedial) programs to the percentage of minority students in the school as a whole. These programs are designed largely although not entirely for minority students, because they have on average more educational deficits. To forbid these students access to these programs on the ground that it would foster unfavorable stereotypes is the kind of 'benign discrimination' thinking ...that the courts have long rejected\").\\n \\nSo the rule was wrong to financially penalize school districts for not achieving such racial balance. Doing so ignored settled canons of statutory construction. Statutes should not be interpreted as pressuring regulated entities to use race unless there is no plausible alternative reading of the law. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 923 (1995) (\"Although we have deferred to the [Justice] Department's interpretation in certain statutory cases . . . we have rejected agency interpretations to which we would otherwise defer where they raise serious constitutional questions. . . When the Justice Department's interpretation of the Act compels race-based districting, it by definition raises a serious constitutional question . . . and should not receive deference\"); Lutheran Church v. FCC, 141 F.3d 344 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (pressure on regulated entity to use race was unconstitutional). \\n\\nPenalizing an entity for not meeting \"racial targets or quotas\" raises \"difficult constitutional questions,\" even when the entity has previously been found guilty of discrimination (which is not the case for the regulated entities subject to this rule). See Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2524 (2015).   \n",

The regulation and guidance unnecessarily, and we believe improperly, restricts quality employment and is inconsistent with the intent of Congress. I am the President & CEO of ServiceSource, headquartered in Oakton, Virginia.

These improper mandates also conflicted with federal appeals court rulings about whether Title IX reaches off-campus conduct, and also conflicted with past administrative rulings by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (such as about appeal rights and regulation of off-campus conduct). And they improperly pressured colleges to restrict cross-examination by the accused, even though the right of the accused to personally cross-examine the accuser is specifically protected by some court rulings and state Administrative Procedures Acts.\\n\\nAttached are two articles I published at CNS News explaining why the Dear Colleague Letter and the 2014 \"Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence\" should be rescinded. The first focuses on the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, the second on the 2014 guidance. (See (1) Hans Bader, \"Time to End Obama-Era Fed Micromanagement of Colleges Under Title IX,\" Feb. 22, 2017, available at http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/time-end-obama-era-fed-micromanagement-colleges-under-title-ix ; (2) Bader,\"Obama-Era DOE Instructions Disregard SCOTUS Interpretation of Title IX,\" CNS News, Feb. 27, 2017, available at http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/obama-era-doe-instructions-disregard-scotus-interpretation-title-ix ).\\n\\nThe first two attachments are these articles in Microsoft Word.\\nThe last two attachments are these articles in PDF form.\\n\\nThese articles discuss court rulings at odds with the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 guidance, such as Roe v. St. Louis University, 746 F.3d 874, 884 (8th Cir. 2014), which held that a university had no responsibility over an off-campus rape, and past OCR rulings at odds with them, such as an Office for Civil Rights ruling in 2004 that a University does not have a duty under Title IX to address an incident of alleged harassment where the incident occurs off-campus and does not involve a program or activity of the recipient.

We submit these comments to express our support of the 2011 Title IX Dear Colleague Letter including the clarification by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the correct evidentiary standard for sexual harassment cases (preponderance of the evidence). \\n\\nSexual violence is widespread and devastating to survivors. The clarifications in the Dear Colleague guidance were needed and welcome because of the serious, discriminatory harms that victims of sexual face as a result of their experiences and entrenched victim blaming attitudes. \\n\\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letters clarifications of OCRs previous regulatory guidance and enforcement actions are fully consistent with the civil rights approach to discriminatory harassment and the rules in the vast majority of other civil proceedings.

We support the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) correct clarification that the evidentiary standard in campus disciplinary hearings is preponderance of the evidence. \\n\\nSexual assault is widespread and devastating to survivors on campus and in K-12 education settings. Victims can experience serious, discriminatory harms, and the issuance of the 2011 Dear Colleague letter was compelled by the acute needs of students. The letters clarifications of OCRs previous regulatory guidance and enforcement actions are fully consistent with the civil rights approach to discriminatory harassment and the rules in the vast majority of other civil proceedings.  Indeed, if OCR had adopted a different approach, it would have engaged in a dangerous kind of exceptionalism for only sexual violence and its victims, the majority of whom are women and girls. \\n\\nOn behalf of survivors, state sexual assault coalitions and local programs serving survivors and providing prevention education in their communities, we urge the U.S. Department of Education to keep the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter in place as extraordinarily helpful existing regulatory guidance articulating necessary, legally correct, and historically-followed standards that help both students and schools.\\n\\nPlease see the attached position paper which goes into more detail on our views on these critical issues. \\n   \n",
       "8178                                    I am a Lecturer on Law and the founding Director of the Gender Violence Program at Harvard Law School. I have taught a course on Title IX every year since 2007. I have previously served as Senior Counsel in the Office on Violence Against Women at the US Department of Justice, and prior to that served as an Executive Assistant Attorney General in Illinois.  I worked with the Department of Education in the Obama Administration on its initiatives to address the national problem of campus sexual violence. The Harvard Law School Gender Violence Program contributed to the work of the White House Task Force on Protecting Students from Sexual Assault in 2014. I have worked with students across the country on this problem, helping survivors retain an educational foothold in the aftermath of an assault. I have worked with schools in achieving compliance with Title IX and have lectured extensively on the topic. I also appear in The Hunting Ground, an acclaimed documentary on campus sexual assault.\\n\\nThe Gender Violence Program partners with Futures Without Violence and the University of Virginia to offer a curriculum on Changing the Narrative on Gender-Based Violence on Campus. It includes best practices on a school's duties to prevent, respond and resolve cases of sexual misconduct under Title IX. We offer this curriculum with a faculty of national experts on violence prevention and provide it regionally across the country. \\n\\nI have attached two recent articles of mine-one from the Harvard Law Review regarding \"target rapes\" on campus; the other a recent opinion editorial published in the Washington Post. I have other publications available on request.  I am a signatory to the White Paper on the preponderance standard submitted by Professor Nancy Chi Cantalupo and others.\\n\\nI write to support the OCR DCL of April 2011 and to urge the DOE not to abandon the considerable work it has done to enforce Title IX's important equality guarantees. The DOE should continue advising schools on fair implementation of their responsibilities to prevent and address campus sexual assault. Special rights for the accused is not legally consistent with the civil rights provisions of Title IX. Fair process, as provided for in the 2011 DCL and the Campus SaVE Act, mandates equal treatment for both sides with an emphasis on victim safety, public safety, and offender accountability. Schools must be able to keep their campuses safe for all students. Each of the problems cited by Secretary DeVos to justify scrapping the DCL was a Title IX violation--not a problem caused by compliance with an unfair regulation. It is urgently necessary to work with schools on the fair implementation of policies and procedures to effect Title IX's promise of equal access to educational opportunities. Creating a new evidentiary standard of clear and convincing would be confusing to schools; would create a discriminatory system for sexual violence cases when preponderance of the evidence is the standard for all other civil rights cases; and in itself would create an unnecessary regulatory morass rather than streamlining regulation as requested in this evaluation of existing regulations. Rather, the DOE should work with schools on fair processes as currently required--if one party has a right to present evidence, have counsel, or to appeal, etc.,  so too does the other party. DOE should ensure schools have trained investigators and adjudicators and trauma-informed responses so that a student reporting sexual misconduct is not further harmed in terms of access to educational opportunities. It should help schools to explore resolutions that promote the purpose of Title IX. The building blocks for such important action have been set, and the DOE should continue this work, but not by overreacting to claims of the accused and their academic supporters who imagine having been struck down by a pendulum swing in favor of victims or survivors of sexual assault. For years, sexual offenders were getting away with assaulting other students on campus. If we don't hold offenders accountable, the scourge of sexual violence on college campuses will continue unabated. The 2011 DCL is a critical guidance document to schools to help them achieve compliance with Title IX's civil rights provisions. While the DOE can and should continue to hold schools accountable to provide fair processes, changing substantially the evidentiary standard would signify a retreat on its important enforcement role. Moreover, it would be legally inconsistent with civil rights and anti-discrimination laws, and thus would lead to unnecessary and avoidable excessive litigation. The current comments ask how to reduce regulations--I respectfully submit that such reduction can be achieved by continuing a regulatory framework already in place rather than disrupting it. To do so will subvert the stated purpose of this evaluation of existing regulations. \\n\\nSee attached file(s)   \n",

       "8286             FR Doc # 2017-13157\\nPlease see attached file: FACE REGULATION COMMENTS; RECOMMENDED TITLE IX DUE PROCESS PROCEDURES\\n\\nFamilies Advocating for Campus Equality (FACE)  submits the attached document in response to request for comments by U.S. Department of Education Proposed Rule: Evaluation of Existing Regulations, in accordance with Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda.\" \\n\\nThe attached document recommends procedures essential to ensure college and university Title IX disciplinary processes provide unbiased assessments of facts and evidence.  FACE's recommendations are based on reports from hundreds of students who have contacted us for support and advocacy over the past several years after being wrongfully accused of or found responsible for sexual misconduct. FACE is the only U.S. organization able to provide numerous student experiences exposing schools' desperate need for explicit guidance on implementing fair and balanced disciplinary procedures. \\n\\nNo one denies that sexual assault, on or off campus, is a heinous crime and those found responsible should be severely punished. However, enacting effective campus sexual assault prevention measures which protect victims while judiciously determining guilt cannot be accomplished in a vacuum. The creation of an effective strategy requires extensive research and consultation with those who possess expertise in many fields, including higher education, sexual violence and the law. \\n\\nSecretary of Education DeVos has received overwhelming support from across the political spectrum for her plan to \"launch a transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\" Widespread public notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides the architecture for Americans' right to influence rules and regulations that will affect them, their organizations and their livelihoods. It is a method by which agencies are held accountable, and compliance provides assurance that agency decisions are fact-based and objective, and not the result of a particular political or social agenda. \\n\\nThe Department of Education Office for Civil Rights' (OCR) attempt to resolve campus sexual misconduct issues through guidance such as its April 4, 2011 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" (DCL), without subjecting it to public notice and comment was well-intentioned but imprudent. The fact that the DCL was issued by unelected and unaccountable government officials seeking to change sexual behavior through public policy undoubtedly has lead to the DCL's many shortcomings and devastating unintended consequences.  Many FACE students suspended or expelled following misguided or result-driven disciplinary processes have suffered tremendous emotional, educational and career-destroying impacts traceable to the 2011 DCL.\\n\\nOCR guaranteed compliance with its directives by subjecting institutions to onerous Title IX investigations, publicizing institutions' names prior to findings of wrongdoing and threatening to withhold their federal funding.  However, the broad responsibilities OCR imposed upon institutions of higher education have been uniformly criticized as unfair, inequitable and generally ineffective at educating students about or preventing sexual misconduct on college and university campuses.  \\n\\nThe 2011 DCL also neglected to provide campuses with tangible tools to accomplish the broad policy goals it sought to achieve. These omissions are particularly troublesome given the fact-specific nature of most campus sexual misconduct disputes and the importance and extreme difficulty of accurately assessing credibility in \"he said/she said\" cases, particularly when alcohol is a factor. As such, the DCL's proscribed policies do not assist campus administrators in negotiating the extremely complex issues inherent in investigating and adjudicating campus sexual misconduct disputes. \\n\\nCourts across the country are increasingly recognizing that schools are not providing the basic fairness one would expect from an institution of higher education and finding that DCL-mandated disciplinary procedures have lead to biased and often predetermined results. There have been nearly seventy decisions in favor of accused students in the past three years, almost thirty of which were decided in 2017 alone.\\n\\nFACE appreciates your consideration of our suggestions to help ensure campus disciplinary proceedings are transparent and unbiased, and individual disciplinary decisions are not motivated by threats of penalties or political pressure to report a threshold number of sexual assaults. We believe the integrity of campus disciplinary decisions will be ensured and prevention efforts more successful when decisions are based on fair procedures, reasonable and objective behavioral standards and the decision-makers' independent evaluation of all available relevant and reliable evidence.\\n\\n   \n",

We strongly believe that all students deserve and are entitled to a quality education in an environment free of violence.  Unfortunately, this is not a reality for many students with marginalized identities, especially students who identify as people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, and Muslims.  When a school or school district perpetrates or allows violence, civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in.  In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We fully support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.  Which is why, we oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\\n\\nThrough our community work, we know firsthand that LGBTQ students face extensive barriers to educational success.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report that found 17.8% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students have been forced to have sexual intercourse compared to 5.4% of heterosexual high school students. The largest national survey examining the experiences of transgender people in the U.S. found that 13% of respondents who were out or perceived as transgender in K-12 were sexually assaulted because of their gender identity. This same report also found that 54% of Transgender K-12 students have experienced verbal harassment, and 24% were physically attacked.  This violence and mistreatment was so pervasive that 17% of transgender students left a K-12 school, and 6% were expelled. For transgender individuals who continued onto college or vocation school, 24% experienced verbal, physical, or sexual harassment during their high education experience. The 2015 AAU Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct determined that 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, and non-conforming) college students have been sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN females, and 4% of non-TGQN males. Any rollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of LGBTQ student survivors, making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they experience their school environments.\\n\\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all students. We urge you not to roll-back these protections. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs\\n   \n",

I live in Cary, North Carolina. I am writing in response to the U.S. Department of Educations request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform.\\n\\nI am using my role as a parent and my work as an education advocate to advise you that the test of any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and other administrative activity must advance educational equity and serve the interests of all students. I believe Education Departments focus is narrow in this regulatory review, as it tilts too far toward reducing burden on, entities significantly affected by Federal regulations, while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nations education laws  students. \\n\\nOn behalf of children with disabilities in my school district in North Carolina (Wake County Public School System), the 200,000 + children with Individualized duration Plans receiving special education services  in the state of North Carolina, and their families, that I make the following recommendations:\\n\\n1.Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\\n\\nI strongly recommend that Education Department thoroughly review and maintain, regulation, joint regulations and guidance related to the following laws:\\n\\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), of 1965, as  amended currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\\n\\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX)\\n\\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\\n\\nThe Higher Education Act (HEA)\\n\\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\\n\\nThe Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act (WIOA)\\n\\nThe Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act (PERKINS)\\n\\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\\n\\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\\n\\n \\nAs this relates to IDEA,  in particular, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232, states: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed, pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation.\\n\\n1. I urge department to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\\n\\n2..  Maintain the majority of Education Department Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\\n\\n3. Rescind a select few Dear Colleagues Letters (DLC)that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the schools system under the IDEA\\n\\n4.Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\\n \\n\\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nCynthia Daniels-Hall\\nDirector, Special Education Advocacy\\nEveryChild Solutions \\n\\n\"There is no more powerful advocate for children than a parent armed with information and options.\"~ Rod Paige\\n\\n   \n",

       "15330  Comments:  Howard Community College, OPEID 00817500 \\nDocket ID:  ED-2017-OS-0074\\n\\nHoward Community College (HCC) welcomes this opportunity to comment on whether Title IV postsecondary education regulations should be repealed, modified, or replaced.  HCC is located in Columbia Maryland.  We enrolled 14,467 credit students in FY2016 and 15,571 noncredit continuing education students.  Almost a quarter of graduating seniors from Howard County high schools in 2016 enrolled at HCC in Fall 2016, and 42% of undergraduate students living in the county attend HCC.  The average age of our student is 26 years old and 37% of our students enroll fulltime.  Forty-eight percent (48%) of fall 2016 credit students received financial aid during their enrollment at HCC.   Seventy-one percent (71%) of our aid recipients are Pell Grant students.  Thirty percent (30%) of our aid recipients borrowed from the student loan programs, which is 10% of our enrolled students.\\n\\nWe concur with the comments submitted by the American Association of Community Colleges, and would like to emphasize a few of the points made by AACC in the comments below.\\n\\nProgram Integrity:  Gainful Employment Regulations\\n\\nWe are pleased that ED has already undertaken the process to reopen negotiated rulemaking proceedings to modify the gainful employment (GE) regulations.  We agree with the basic approach to create GE eligibility metrics for individual GE programs, which show whether students who complete GE programs are subsequently able to repay their student loans without undue burden in a reasonable time period. Our understanding is that the vast majority of community college GE programs were never in any danger of failing the debt-to-earnings metric (and none did).    Howard Community College has 27 GE programs, and only one program had earnings published (verified student count of 17 with median earnings  of $60,704 and mean earnings of $58,273) and no programs had a sufficient number of borrowers for a debt to earnings ratio to be published.   The cost of implementing the GE regulations is enormous, involving staff across many academic and administrative office, and there was no benefit to our students.\\n\\nWe recommend that the GE regulations should exempt institutions and/or programs that have a history of low borrowing. Most community colleges have well below 50% of their students borrowing federal loans.   Only about 10% of HCC's enrolled students borrow from the loan program, and even far less than that percentage of students who are enrolled specifically in the GE programs.    Therefore we recommend that our GE programs should be exempted from the current GE reporting regulations and any new GE regulations, other than some basic program disclosures referred to below. \\n\\nAdditionally, we agree with AACC's recommendation that a minimum threshold be set for the number of Title IV students enrolled in the program in order to require reporting on GE programs to align with confidentiality and other rules. This includes almost all of HCC's GE programs.\\n\\nReturn of Title IV Funds:  \\n\\nThese regulations are the most complex of the Title IV regulations and they are the most difficult to implement in a community college.  The complexity of these regulations basically requires that these calculations be done manually.   The complexity is not in the math, but in the gathering of the correct enrollment data for the calculation.   The reason why this area remains one of the top 3 findings in program reviews and audits for the past decade is not because colleges do not put the time and effort into complying, it's because it's too complex to automate and too complex to be able to reliably do a manual calculation for hundreds of students each term.   HCC has surveyed other community colleges and on average, it takes about 30 minutes per withdrawn student to complete the r2t4 calculation process from start to finish.   The ACE report proposes modifications to several provisions of these regulations to ease the burden of compliance. \\n\\nVerification and ISIR Comment Codes: \\n\\nIt's the highest need students, Pell eligible applicants, who are most subject to having to gather additional documentation to validate the information they submitted on the FAFSA.   This occurs as a part of the verification process and also through various comment codes assigned by the U.S. Department of Education on the ISIR.Simplifying the FAFSA but increasing the complexity of the documentation required to complete the file does not improve access for high need students.   We recommend that the simplification approach be also applied on the \"back end\" to make it easier for students to complete their financial aid file.   One critical issue that we hope doesn't occur again is the shutdown of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA. \\n\\nThank you for your consideration of these comments.

We \\nunderstand that comments are being received as it relates to repealing, adjusting and/or changing the rulemaking related to \\nthe Javits Wagner O'Day Act under what is known as AbilityOne, and the treatment of those opportunities as not \"competitive\\nand integrated\" for the purposes of WIOA. Our comments support maintaining the current regulations as they exist, in \\nparticular, as they relate to the treatment of AbilityOne programs as being defined as not \"competitive and integrated\" for \\nthe purposes of WIOA.\\n\\nAbilityOne, the brand name for the implementation of the Javits Wagner O'Day Act (JWOD), passed in 1938, and refreshed \\nin 1971, is charged with providing training and employment opportunities to people who are blind or severely disabled. The \\nprogram effectively merged (as was the purpose of such Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) programs) the training with \\nemployment for people with disabilities. The passage of WIOA and subsequent rulemaking provided an opportunity to \\nbifurcate the two functions, particularly for those providing employment and training to people with disabilities.\\n\\nIt is my contention that the WIOA rulemaking as it relates to sheltered workshops, of which JWOD is, marks the \\nculmination of a long progression of civil rights development to shift from segregation of people with disabilities in the \\nemployment realm. WIOA will ensure that a managerial shift of those organizations currently operating under JWOD \\nwill have to synthesize with the new regulations and will simply be formalizing what is already occurring in the disability \\nemployment and training community. Moreover, many advocates for people with disabilities see sheltered workshops as \\nlimiting for those who are employed in them, particularly where direct labor requirements are employed.\\n\\nAbilityOne nonprofits are one of the largest employers of people with disabilities in the nation, and the federal \\ngovernment's paradoxical position on the matter is one which must be reconciled. However, such a reconciliation \\nis for participants in the program to synthesize, and options are available AbilityOne nonprofits to become \\nCompetitive and Integrated under the WIOA law. A solution has been presented to Congress and the Section 809\\npanel in the form of a White Paper (attached below). Fundamentally, the DEd got the regulations correct. Pushing \\nAbilityOne to have to adjust to the modern work environment, and examining how JWOD fits the modern economy, \\nis an essential part of the regulations. The intent is to mainstream Competitive and Integrated opportunities and I \\nstrongly believe the WIOA regulations are the right direction to meet that objective. Alternatively, maintaining the \\nstatus quo will be a huge step back from the Competitive and Integrated push for people with disabilities. Please \\nsee the attached White Paper for further detail on the role WIOA and JWOD could play with ensuring \\nCompetitive and Integrated opportunities for those with disabilities. \\n   \n",

Headquartered in New Britain, CT, we employ over 1,000 individuals with significant disabilities in meaningful and well-paying jobs throughout the country, many of whom are employed at military bases and prestigious government facilities as a direct result of the AbilityOne program.  \\nOur comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations and guidance are stripping away the rights of people with disabilities by closing off meaningful and well-paying jobs for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \\nIn the absence of the AbilityOne program, many of the individuals we serve would not be employed or would be working in lower paying positions with minimal to no benefits.  The unemployment rate for people with disabilities continues to be high, despite good intentions and various policies designed to increase employment.  Eliminating and limiting job opportunities for any group of people, specifically for people with significant disabilities is unfair and disheartening. \\nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA not only restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities; it is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance. As an employer in a number of states, some of the vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies are discounting any AbilityOne job which is problematic and can lead to unfilled positions.  \\nWe respectfully request that the DoEd immediately rescind the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/wioa/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne Program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). This is an Employment First approach which not only supports \\n\\nindividual choice but will lead to the employment for many individuals with significant disabilities in the future. \\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSandra M.

We have a son with a rare syndrome called Pallister Killian Syndrome. He is 1 of 2 in the state of MN to have this. Our son has severe medical issues along with deaf/blindness. We live in the greater Minnesota region, so we do not have access to some of the schools where they have supports for this type of student. We have spent the last 9 years trying to educate our schools on how they can help our son. We knew early on about Interveners and had them in our home setting where we witnessed their profound impact on communication and connecting with our son. They have helped us gain tools to connect with our son when we didn't think it was possible. This has been transformational in a very unique situation that empowered us as a family to do all we could to help him understand his world around him. It wasn't until we had gone to mediation with the school due to differences in what they thought our son needed in the education system, where they finally brought in some Deaf/Blind Professionals who helped point out where his education was lacking. Mostly it was communication. Our son was 11 years old at this point and still didn't have a formal communication plan in school. If you can only imagine not hearing, not seeing and not connecting with your world for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week with people who did not understand you. I beg of you to push for this wording. We are a very small group but our kids CAN learn. They deserve a voice and to be heard. They just need a different way of doing so. With this regulation added to the list of related services, our children will have a chance to a meaningful education. This will save so much unnecessary grief for both the family and school system, but mostly, it will provide the student with an education that is appropriate for their disability of access. Thank you for your time.   \n",

Toolworks has never paid sub-minimum wage and has never pursued these types of opportunities. Our workforce is integrated. We understand the intent behind this regulation, but the affect actually puts these opportunities for people with disabilities to have full time employment that offers a living wage at risk. We believe that working with the Commission to make other AbilityOne programs more closely mirror ours to be a more effective approach than the current regulations.\\n\\nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the department's longstanding practice and technical guidance. My state's vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency is one of at least 19 states VR that have stopped referring and placing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program. \\nToolworks is a NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and employs over 100 individuals with disabilities in a variety of positions. Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased employment opportunities at my agency are going un-filled. Deserving individuals with significant disabilities are denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our community.  \\n\\n   \n",

IDEA and these regulations are critical to continuing the progress made over the last 30 years to ensure young children with or at risk for disabilities and their families receive the services they need to reach their full potential. The Division for Early Childhood (DEC) of the Council for Exceptional Children is the largest membership organization focused solely on the development and education of young children (ages birth8) with or at risk for disabilities and other special needs and their families. As such, DEC sees no need for repeal, replacement or modification of any IDEA regulations at this time and notes that changes to regulations are better addressed in the context of a reauthorization.  The current process is outside of the usual order, and as a result, is likely to lack the in-depth stakeholder input and public discussion critical to the success of such an activity.   \\n\\nIDEA and its implementing regulations are designed to address both access to early intervention and special education for children with disabilities, as well as the quality of those services. IDEA Parts A, B and C, outline the rights, responsibilities and infrastructures to ensure access to early intervention and education for eligible children and their families. In Part D, IDEA provides for investments in the quality of those services and infrastructures. Part D provides funding for parent support and information centers and the demonstration and dissemination of evidence-based, effective practices.\\n\\nThere is no doubt in the field of education and in the experiences of families, that IDEA is a success. Certainly, there are challenges in implementing such a broad and visionary policy and federal action can indeed assist in these efforts. But the answer to these challenges is not to revise or reduce IDEA regulations.  Quite the contrary, these regulations support efforts to implement IDEA successfully.  Fully funding IDEA federally would go a long way to addressing the challenges states and communities are facing.  \\n\\nIDEA has a federal infrastructure that implementation science tells us is necessary for the installation of effective practices. This infrastructure includes guidance from OSEP in best practice, accountability, and monitoring. For the early childhood provisions of IDEA (Part C and Section 619 of Part B), OSEP provides policy guidance as needed to state leaders to assist in their efforts to help local early intervention programs and school districts implement effective policies, practices and accountability measures while also holding them accountable to indicators of compliance and quality. \\n\\nIDEA early childhood programs also serve as a key mechanism of supports and services for young children with disabilities in community settings such as preschool, Head Start, Home Visiting and child care/early learning.  DEC appreciates the valuable policy guidance that has been released in the last several years through collaboration across federal programs in the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services as well as other federal agencies as needed.  This federal collaborative work has resulted in the release of a number of powerful policy statements from the respective Secretaries to assist local programs serving young children in understanding best practice giving all young children opportunities to succeed and be ready for school. DEC requests that the Department continue these efforts.  State and community leaders speak very highly of these policy statements and express how their use has helped further efforts for young children and families at the community level.  Examples of these policy statements include, but are not limited to, high quality inclusion, reducing and eliminating suspension and expulsion, and strengthening partnerships with families. \\n\\nDECs membership, representing all states, includes a diverse population of teachers, related service personnel, administrators, families, higher education faculty, and researchers. \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this important matter.

These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious, job-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \\nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the department's longstanding practice and technical guidance. My state's vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency is one of at least 19 states VR that have stopped referring and placing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program. \\nPRIDE Industries is an NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and creates over 2100   jobs through this program. The average pay on these jobs is over 16.00 per hour with full benefits.   Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased employment opportunities at my agency are going un-filled. Deserving individuals with significant disabilities are denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our community.  \\nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEd's website, https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/wioa/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation.\\nSincerely,\\n\\n PRIDE Industries\\n10030 Foothills Blvd\\nRoseville CA.  95747\\n\\n   \n",

If regulated entities do\\nnot achieve \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificant disproportionality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in group outcome, even for reasons beyond their control,\\n15% of their funds are diverted to coordinated, early intervening services.

And they give parents and the public an\\nobjective measure of how schools are doing at improving learning for all groups of students.\\nIn 2016, the negotiated rulemaking committee came to a consensus on the regulations now in place.

       "2427                            b'August 7, 2017\\nDear Members of the United State Department of Education Regulatory Reform Task Force:\\nI am writing to request your assistance in reviewing and revoking regulation and guidance,\\npromulgated by USDOE during the last Administration, which is significantly negatively\\naffecting job options for people with disabilities. The regulation and guidance unnecessarily, and\\nwe believe improperly, restricts quality employment and is inconsistent with the intent of\\nCongress. I am the President & CEO of ServiceSource, headquartered in Oakton, Virginia.\\nServiceSource is a regional non-profit that serves over 25,000 people annually with a wide array\\nof disabling conditions and employment and support needs. ServiceSource regularly uses the\\nnational AbilityOne Program to access quality employment opportunities so that people with\\ndisabilities can become gainfully employed.\\nMy comments are specific to the below regulation and regulatory guidance contained within:\\nRegulation ID: ED-2015-OSERS-001-1167\\nDate Posted:Aug 19, 2016\\nRIN:1820-AB70\\nCFR:34 CFR Parts 361, 363, and 397\\nFederal Register Number:2016-15980\\nThe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), signed into law in 2014, was a\\nbipartisan success intended to support individuals with disabilities to obtain competitive\\nintegrated employment.\\nSubsequent to the passage of WIOA, the USDOE/Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA)\\nbegan promulgating guidance concerning the implementation of WIOA. That guidance included\\nwhat amounts to a regulatory \\xe2\\x80\\x9cre-definition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of competitive integrated employment that is neither\\na part of the WIOA law nor does it reflect the intent of Congress.\\nThe re-definition of competitive integrated employment targets the AbilityOne Program and\\nparticipating non-profit agencies across the country as ineligible to be considered competitive\\nintegrated employment settings simply because they affirmatively hire persons with disabilities.\\nMoreover, the guidance being promulgated by the RSA strips persons with significant disabilities,\\nwho express an interest in becoming employed or are receiving supports to maintain employment,\\nof state vocational rehabilitation support. The AbilityOne Program is the largest source of\\nemployment in the United States for individuals who are blind or have significant disabilities.\\n\\n\\x0cThe employment settings that these individuals work within are among the most diverse settings\\nin the country and include installations within all branches of the military and virtually every\\ndepartment and agency of the Federal government. AbilityOne employment includes full\\nprevailing wages and benefits and significant promotional and outplacement opportunities.\\nThis guidance and the understanding of the AbilityOne Program is simply wrong. ServiceSource\\nis proud to be one of more than 550 non-profit businesses across the country who create jobs with\\nour government partners in the AbilityOne Program and with private employers for persons with\\nsignificant disabilities. ServiceSource has a 35-year history of participation in the AbilityOne\\nProgram and currently employs or facilitates the employment of more than 1,000 persons with\\nsignificant disabilities in integrated AbilityOne employment settings in over 75 Federal\\ninstallations. Nearly 70 percent of the persons employed came to our organization through the\\nsupport and referral of state vocational rehabilitation.\\nUnfortunately, referrals from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased in many states\\nin which we operate, citing restrictive guidance from the RSA. Jobs are going un-filled and job\\ncreation for persons with the most barriers to employment is slowing dramatically as a result.\\nOther non-profits across the country that participate in the AbilityOne Program are reporting\\nsimilar impacts. In fact, since this change in definition became effective in September 2016, state\\nvocational rehabilitation agencies in 20 states are no longer making referrals for employment\\nwithin AbilityOne settings.\\nWe greatly support this Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common sense approach to identifying and removing\\njob- stifling regulations. Although the balance of the regulations contained in ED-2015-OSERS001-1167 are not at issue, this singular re-definition of competitive integrated employment causes\\nserious harm to job seekers with significant disabilities and job creating organizations across the\\ncountry. We hope you will rescind RSA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s improper re-definition of competitive integrated\\nemployment and require strong direction to the field restoring previous definition, guidance and\\npractice.\\nI would be pleased to speak more with the members of the Task Force should you require further\\ninformation.

A great way to restore\\nlocal control would be rescind the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s federal micromanagement of college\\ndiscipline. Under Obama, the Education Department sometimes pressured colleges to do things\\nthat could lead to lawsuits being filed against them by their students.\\nFor example, the Education Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s April 4, 2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letter urged colleges\\nto restrict cross-examination in sexual harassment and assault cases. As its Office for Civil\\nRights (OCR) put it in that letter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOCR strongly discourages schools from allowing the parties\\npersonally to question or cross-examine each other during the hearing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When schools take that\\nadvice, it can violate a student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights under a state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Administrative Procedure Act\\n(APA). Under many state APAs, students have a right to cross-examine their accuser, as courts\\nhave made clear in cases such as Arishi v. Washington State University, 385 P.3d 251 (Wash.\\nApp. 2016) and Liu v. Portland State University, 383 P.3d 294 (Or. App. 2016).\\n(It is conceivable that the advice in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letter could also lead to violations of\\nfederal law at colleges that follow it. In a few campus disciplinary cases, such as Donohue v.\\nBaker, 976 F.Supp. 136 (N.D.N.Y. 1997), and Doe v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 2016 WL 6996194\\n(S.D. Oh. 2016), judges have ruled that some cross-examination was constitutionally required on\\ndue-process grounds to test the credibility of the accuser. But the Supreme Court has not ruled on\\nwhether cross-examination is ever required by the federal constitution in the college setting, even\\nthough it lauded cross-examination as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery\\nof truth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in its decision in Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 124 (1999).)\\nThe Education Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Letter purported to apply the federal sex\\ndiscrimination law Title IX. But it misconstrued Title IX, as I explain in detail at this link.\\nMoreover, in advising colleges to restrict the rights of their students, it ignored language in a\\n1999 Supreme Court ruling that emphasized that schools don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to risk violating the rights of\\ntheir students to comply with Title IX. In setting forth a standard for when schools need to take\\naction against sexual harassment or assault by students, the Supreme Court said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nstandard set out here is sufficiently flexible to account both for the level of disciplinary authority\\navailable to the school and for the potential liability arising from certain forms of disciplinary\\naction. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 [I]t would be entirely reasonable for a school to refrain from a form of disciplinary\\n\\n\\x0caction that would expose it to constitutional or statutory claims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (See Davis v. Monroe County\\nBoard of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 649 (1999)).\\nThe Supreme Court plainly meant to allow colleges to avoid acting in ways giving rise to\\nstatutory claims against them under both federal and state law, since it was in response to a\\ndissenting opinion that cited both federal and state laws limiting the ability of schools to\\ndiscipline students (such as state constitutional provisions. See Davis, at pg. 649, citing the\\ndissenting opinion in Davis, at pp. 666-668).\\nIn addition to ignoring the Supreme Court, this Obama-era \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d letter also wrongly\\nimposed new obligations on schools without notice and comment, in violation of the\\nAdministrative Procedure Act (as I explained earlier). For example, it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cignored past Office for\\nCivil Rights rulings authored by its own career lawyers and civil servants in forcing colleges to\\ninvestigate off-campus conduct. Such \\xe2\\x80\\x98unexplained departures from precedent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are arbitrary and\\ncapricious, as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals noted in Ramaprakash v. FAA (2003). The\\nObama administration also ignored two federal appeals court rulings, and language in a Supreme\\nCourt decision, by demanding that colleges do so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nIn its April 4, 2011 letter, the Office for Civil Rights told colleges they \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave an obligation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to\\ninvestigate even when an incident \\xe2\\x80\\x9coccurred off school grounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This contradicted what OCR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncareer staff told colleges in Title IX rulings during the Bush administration, when I worked t...  \n",

Employers are not always expected to prevent a recurrence of harassment by their\\nemployees, much less remedy all the effects of harassment. When harassment is committed by a\\nnon-supervisory employee, the employer is only liable if it was negligent. If an employer takes\\naction \\xe2\\x80\\x9creasonably calculated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to deter further harassment, it is not liable under Title VII of the\\nCivil Rights Act, even if harassment unexpectedly recurred or persisted. (See, e.g., Adler v. WalMart, 164 F.3d 664 (10th Cir. 1998) (in which an appeals court ruled that an employer that\\ndisciplined most of the harassers, except one that it plausibly viewed as innocent, was not liable\\neven though harassment unexpectedly recurred, because the employer was not negligent)).\\nAd Feedback\\n\\n\\x0cThe employer is not always even required to impose \\xe2\\x80\\x9csanctions against the perpetrator.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For\\nexample, if the evidence is unclear about whether the accused was guilty, the employer may\\nescape liability even if it declined to discipline that employee. (See Swenson v. Potter, 271 F.3d\\n1184, 1196 (9th Cir. 2001) (appeals court ruling reversing jury verdict for plaintiff because\\nharasser\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilt was so murky that employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to discipline him was reasonable); Knabe v.\\nBoury Corporation, 114 F.3d 407 (3rd Cir. 1997) (appeals court ruling affirming dismissal of\\nlawsuit over harassment where employer refused to discipline alleged harasser due to lack of\\ncorroborating witness)).\\nThe Supreme Court has said that schools\\xe2\\x80\\x99 liability for student misconduct under Title IX is\\nnarrower than employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 liability for employee misconduct under Title VII. In its 1999 decision\\nin Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 648-49 (1999), it noted both that\\na Title IX student plaintiff must show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeliberate indifference\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the school to obtain money\\ndamages, and also that Title IX doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give complainants a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to second-guess a school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nreasonable decisions about discipline, since there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTitle IX right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticular\\nremedial demands\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticular disciplinary action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d just because harassment has occurred:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe stress that our conclusion here ... does not mean that recipients can avoid liability only by\\npurging their sch...  \n",

WalMart, 164 F.3d 664 (10th Cir. 1998) (in which an appeals court ruled that an employer that\\ndisciplined most of the harassers, except one that it plausibly viewed as innocent, was not liable\\neven though harassment unexpectedly recurred, because the employer was not negligent)).\\nAd Feedback\\n\\n\\x0cThe employer is not always even required to impose \\xe2\\x80\\x9csanctions against the perpetrator.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For\\nexample, if the evidence is unclear about whether the accused was guilty, the employer may\\nescape liability even if it declined to discipline that employee. (See Swenson v. Potter, 271 F.3d\\n1184, 1196 (9th Cir. 2001) (appeals court ruling reversing jury verdict for plaintiff because\\nharasser\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilt was so murky that employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to discipline him was reasonable); Knabe v.\\nBoury Corporation, 114 F.3d 407 (3rd Cir. 1997) (appeals court ruling affirming dismissal of\\nlawsuit over harassment where employer refused to discipline alleged harasser due to lack of\\ncorroborating witness)).\\nThe Supreme Court has said that schools\\xe2\\x80\\x99 liability for student misconduct under Title IX is\\nnarrower than employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 liability for employee misconduct under Title VII. In its 1999 decision\\nin Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629, 648-49 (1999), it noted both that\\na Title IX student plaintiff must show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeliberate indifference\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the school to obtain money\\ndamages, and also that Title IX doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give complainants a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to second-guess a school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nreasonable decisions about discipline, since there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTitle IX right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticular\\nremedial demands\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticular disciplinary action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d just because harassment has occurred:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe stress that our conclusion here ... does not mean that recipients can avoid liability only by\\npurging their sch...  \n",

I am recommending the Department rescind its special\\neducation guidance in Letter to Cox and Letter to Ward (see attachments) for t he f ollowing reasons:\\nLetter to Cox, issued by OSEP on August 21, 2009, addresses the question of what LEAs are required to\\ndo when t wo parents, both with legal authority to make educational decisions for their child, disagree\\non the revocation of consent for special education and related services. This letter makes the following\\nconclusions:\\n1. Under 34 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 300.9(c), a parent may revoke consent for his or her child\\'s receipt of special\\neducation and related services.\\n2. Under 34 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 300.30(b)(l), when more than one person is qualified to act as a parent, the\\nbiological or adoptive parent is presumed to be the parent.\\n3. Therefore, the LEA must accept either parent\\'s revocation of consent and provide both parents w ith\\nprior written notice before ceasing special education and related services.\\n4. After revocation of consent, if the still consenting parent requests services for the student, the\\nrequest must be treated as a request for an initial evaluation. With this reasoning, the revoking parent\\nmay revoke that consent for the initial evaluation, and if so, the LEA must provide a prior written notice\\nceasing the evaluation, whereupon, the consenting parent may subsequently again request an initial\\n\\n\\x0cevaluation. In the meantime, an identified student who has a consenting parent is denied his or her\\nright under the law to receive a Free Appropriate Public Education.\\n5. The consenting parent does not have a right to a due process hearing to contest the revocation of\\nconsent because the revocation of consent is not an action by a public agency.\\n6. The public agency does not have a right to request a due process hearing because 34 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7\\n300.300(b)(4)(ii) precludes due process procedures to obtain a ruling that the services may be provided\\nto the student.\\nI believe the flaws contained in this guidance are that:\\nConclusion 2 is based on a regulation providing a parent with a right to revoke consent for special\\neducation services to his or her child. It does not take into account the fact that, in the scenario\\ndescribed in Letter to Cox, there are more than one persons qualified to act as a parent, but both are\\nbiological parents. Thus, the regulation requires both parents to be presumed to be the parent of the\\nchild. Both are presumed to have a right to provide consent, or revoke consent, for services. The\\nregulation itself, however, does not address this particular situation, where the competing parents are\\nboth presumed t o be the parent.\\nConclusion 3 favors a revoking parent over a consenting parent, when there is nothing in the regulation\\nthat requires this conclusion, and directly results in a child with a disability being denied a Free\\nAppropriate Public Education.\\nConclusion 5 is incorrect. The consenting parent does have a right to a due process hearing. The\\nconsenting parent does not have to allege that the revocation of consent is improper, and does not have\\nto bring the due process action against the revoking parent. Rather, the consent ing parent, after\\nreceiving a prior written notice from the LEA notifying the consenting parent that the LEA is proposing to\\nend services, retains the right to request a due process against the LEA to challenge the LEA\\'s decision to\\nend services to a student: (a) that it has evaluated and found eligible for special education services; (b)\\nthat it has developed an IEP it believes the student needs to receive FAPE; and (c) f or whom it has\\ncurrent parent consent to provide the services specified in that IEP. Not only does the consenting\\nparent continue to have this right, when the equities of the case are presented to an impartial hearing\\nofficer, the consenting parent is likely to be the prevailing party. That would result in an LEA which\\nfollows the guidance in Letter to Cox being ...  \n",

As Director of the Health Justice Project at Loyola University Chicago\\nSchool of Law, a medical-legal partnership clinic working to improve the health and well-being\\nof vulnerable children and families, and as an advocate for at risk children and children with\\ndisabilities for over 17 years, I write to ask the Department to ensure the continued protection of\\nthe rights of these vulnerable populations to access a meaningful education. The Department can\\ncontinue to support the opportunities of every student as well as the right of their parents to\\nenable their success through the preservation of the protective implementing regulations and\\nguidance for the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the\\nRehabilitation Act, continued support for the implementation of the Equity in IDEA rules\\nproposed by the Department in February of 2016, and maintain the Guiding Principles: A\\nResource Guide for Improving School Climate and Discipline, the joint guidance package on\\nschool discipline issued by the USDOE and the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) on January\\n8, 2014. Access to a quality education that appropriately meets the needs of at risk children and\\nchildren with disabilities is critical to facilitating opportunities for economic self-sufficiency in\\nlife as well as lifelong health and well-being.\\nFirst, I express my support for the comments submitted by the Council of Parent Attorneys and\\nAdvocates (COPAA) on August 18, 2017 cautioning this Department not to modify of rescind\\nparts of the IDEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementing regulations because of the burdens associated with its\\nimplementation, the comments of the Division for Early Childhood of the Council for\\nExceptional Children submitted on August 9, 2017 seeking preservation of the protective\\nregulations and guidance of the IDEA, and the comments of the Chicago Medical Legal\\nPartnership for Children (CMLPC) of the Legal Council for Health Justice, submitted on\\nSeptember 20, 2017 and proposing amendments to the IDEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementing regulations related\\nto natural environment (\\xc2\\xa7303.126), IFSP Content (\\xc2\\xa7303.344), due process hearing procedures\\n(\\xc2\\xa7303.345-\\xc2\\xa7303.449), child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s status during proceedings (\\xc2\\xa7300.518(a)), state dispute resolution\\n\\n\\x0coptions (\\xc2\\xa7300.430(e)), and support for maintaining the guidance provided by the July 26, 2016\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Colleague Letter and Resource Guide on ADHD).\\nBefore providing my own comments, I want to put in context the basis of my requests for the\\npreservation of the protective features of the IDEA and Section 504 and their implementing\\nregulations and guidance and my suggestions for enhanced protections in certain areas. I have\\nadvocated for students with disabilities in the school setting for over 17 years in four different\\nstates in traditional public schools, charter schools, separate facility schools for children with\\nsevere emotional and behavioral challenges, educational facilities housed in juvenile jails and\\nprisons, and schools for medically fragile children. For the past nine years I have worked with\\npediatric health care providers through medical-legal partnerships in Ohio and Michigan to\\nimprove the health and well-being of children with disabilities and chronic health issues by\\nproviding legal advocacy in collaboration with health and mental health providers. Throughout\\nyears of engaging in this work in multiple states, I write to express to you how essential it is and\\nstudents with disabilities and their parents continue to have the support of the implementing rules\\nand regulations and guidance of the IDEA and Section 504. It is also essential that the U.S.\\nDepartment of Education continue to monitor state education agencies (SEAs) and local\\neducation agencies (LEAs) to ensure compliance with these essential laws established to protect\\nthe rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens, children with disabilities.

We believe the regulations\\naddressed in these comments interfere with the provision of services to the intended customers,\\nbut that fairly simple modifications can remedy these situations.\\nFocusing attention on transition age students is a necessary part of increasing their overall chances\\nto eventually achieve competitive employment. However, by allocating 15% of the federal dollars\\nreceived to Pre-ETS services when no additional funding was provided, already shrinks the funding\\nfor other customers. To additionally exclude the services that are provided to Pre-ETS customers\\nwho have an Individualized Plan for Employment from that 15% can affect the continuity of the\\nservices provided while placing an even greater strain on the provision of services to other\\ncustomers. While later clarifications have included certain activities, postsecondary tuition and fees\\nare still excluded. Specifically, the policy statement in the preamble of 34 C.F.R 361 states:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6a DSU may not use the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services to pay for tuition and\\nother costs of attending postsecondary education, since this is not among those activities that are\\nrequired or authorized under section 113 of the Act and final Section 361.48(a).\\n\\nYet, some aspects of postsecondary education appear to be acceptable in a response in the preamble\\nof the regulation which says:\\n\\nNonetheless, we agree that section 7(37) of the Act, as amended by WIOA, is silent on the\\neducational setting for a student with a disability. After much consideration of the potential\\neffects for such change in interpretation, the Secretary agrees that the definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstudent\\nwith a disability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in final section 361.5(c)(51) for purposes of the VR program, should be\\ninterpreted as applying to students also enrolled in educational programs outside secondary\\nschool, including postsecondary education programs, so long as the students satisfy the age\\nrequirements set forth in final section 361.5(c)(51).\\n\\n\\x0cWhat this means is that much effort is made to prepare a student to successfully navigate gaining\\nan education according to the IPE, only to find that the financial support for which they may\\notherwise qualify may not be available. This exclusion seems arbitrary and should be\\neliminated.\\nA second closely related concern is the possible interruption of service provision that arises from\\nthe separation between Pre-ETS funds and the funding of services once a customer has applied\\nfor rehabilitation services. When \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrder of Selection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is active, it is possible for a transition\\naged customer to be left without services while in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9corder of selection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d window. At the very\\nleast, Pre-ETS funding should be available until vocational rehabilitation services begin.\\nAnother area of concern of our council has been improving the rate of successful closures. We\\nare therefore concerned with the requirement that a case be closed if an Individualized Plan for\\nEmployment is not in place within 90 days of the determination of eligibility for services.\\nSpecifically, regulation 34 C.F.R. 361.45(e) requires that \\xe2\\x80\\x9can IPE be in place not later than 90\\ndays after the date of determination of eligibility, unless the State unit and the eligible individual\\nagree to the extension of that deadline to a specific date by which the individualized plan for\\nemployment must be completed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If unanticipated circumstances prevent a customer from\\nreturning an IPE, for example, such circumstances will likely prevent the agreement for an\\nextension to be completed as well. If a customer has been determined to be eligible and the state\\nagency and the customer have begun to work together to produce an IPE, a case should not be\\nclosed because a customer has not, for example, returned that IPE. While the intent of this\\nregulation is likely to encourage prompt action from the state agency while avoiding the\\nmaintenance of open cases where customers have lost interest, there is a good deal of middle\\nground that should be more clearly defined.\\nCertainly there are additional regulations that deserve review, but the above would seem to have\\nfairly simple solutions. Thank you for considering our comments.\\nBest regards,\\nSteve Jacobson, Chair\\nMinnesota State Rehabilitation Council \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Blind\\n\\n\\x0c'  \n",

I wish to\\nrespond to the U.S. Department of Education\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request for public comment on regulations that\\nmay be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order\\n13777 and as part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d led by the Administration.\\nThe test of any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and/or other administrative activity\\nmust be whether that guidance or regulation increases educational equity and serves the\\ninterests of all students.\\nDO NOT DISREGARD OUR STUDENTS in an effort to reduce a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburden\\xe2\\x80\\x9d burden on the entities\\naffected by Federal regulations.\\nON behalf of children with disabilities, particularly the nearly 20% of our student population\\nwho have learning disabilities, and others with severely-impacting disorders such as ADHD,\\ntrauma from abuse or other event, PLEASE:\\n1.\\n\\nMaintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\\nIn particular, I and the children I serve are most affected by needing to MAINTAIN all\\nregulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws:\\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964\\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\\n\\nAs this relates to IDEA in particular, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 states: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Secretary may not\\nimplement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would\\nprocedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this\\nAct, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate\\nto parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive\\nenvironment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized\\nEducation Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such\\nComments\\xc2\\xa0from\\xc2\\xa0Susan\\xc2\\xa0Farmer\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Docket ID: ED\\xe2\\x80\\x932017\\xe2\\x80\\x93OS\\xe2\\x80\\x930074: Evaluation of Existing Regulations\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nPage\\xc2\\xa01\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\x0cregulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I urge ED to\\nmaintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nMaintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nMaintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\\n\\n4.\\nRescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the\\nIDEA and impede a parent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to be equal partners with the school system under the\\nIDEA.\\nThe letters to rescind are:\\nParent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to include/invite participants to IEP meetings:\\nLetter to Anonymous (2003)\\nLetter to Byrd (2003)\\nRationale: These letters must be rescinded.

Reg. 28431 (June 22, 2017)\\nED-2017-OS-0074-0001\\n\\nDear Ms. Malawer and Dept. of Education personnel:\\nThis comment supplements my original submission in support of a strong Title IX, including strong\\nsupport for existing regulations and guidance on addressing campus sexual assault.\\nI was compelled to file this supplement to correct mis-representations made by Secretary DeVos in\\nher September 7, 2017, statement about the position of the American Bar Association regarding Title\\nIX. Her statement incorrectly implies that the ABA supports the efforts of the Department of\\nEducation (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDOE) to weaken Title IX, including Title IX guidance on campus sexual assault.\\nI am a longtime member of the ABA and the leadership of the ABA Section of Civil Rights and\\nSocial Justice. As a CRSJ leader, I have fought for ABA policy, educational programs, and amicus\\nbriefs in support of Title IX enforcement. During the 2015-2016 academic year I organized and\\nmoderated a free 6-part educational series on Title IX and Campus Sexual Assault: A Civil Rights\\nPerspective for the American Bar Association. I urge DOE and readers of this comment to review\\nthe materials associated with that series.1 Those materials show why currently Title IX policies must\\nbe vigorously enforced - not weakened. While I file this comment on behalf of myself and not on\\nbehalf of the ABA, I am familiar with ABA policy on the issue and I believe that Secretary DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ncharacterization of that policy is incorrect.\\nSecretary DeVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99s September 7, 2017, statement on the DOE website states that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe American Bar\\nAssociation established a task force comprised of lawyers and advocates from diverse backgrounds\\nand varying perspectives. They found consensus and offered substantive ideas on how we can do\\nbetter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/secretary-devos-prepared-remarks-title-ix-enforcement.\\nThis statement inaccurately characterizes the task force and the report. The inaccuracy was\\ncompounded by press reports that cited it, asserting that the report and its recommendations\\nconstitute the position and policy of the ABA.1\\n\\n1\\n\\nhttps://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/events_cle/campus-sexual-assault-teleco\\nnference-series--a-civil-rights-pers.html\\nhttps://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/crsj/csawebpage_programmaterials\\n.authcheckdam.pdf\\n\\n\\x0cFirst, the task force was not an ABA task force. It was a Criminal Justice Section task force\\nestablished by and for members of that Section \\xe2\\x80\\x93 criminal lawyers. The ABA Criminal Justice\\nSection does not and cannot speak for the ABA. It is a small part of a very large organization. Only\\npolicy adopted by the ABA House of Delegates can be cited as the policy and position of the ABA\\nitself. The CJS report and recommendations were NOT adopted by the ABA House of Delegates\\nand thus cannot be represented as the position of the ABA.\\nOther groups within the ABA with expertise in Title IX and campus sexual assault \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the\\nABA Section of Civil Rights and Social Justice (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCRSJ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), the ABA Commission on Domestic and\\nSexual Violence (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCDSV), and the ABA Commission on Women in the Profession \\xe2\\x80\\x94 strongly\\nobjected to the composition of the Criminal Justice Section task force, its hastily convened and\\nclosed meetings, the limited nature of the materials provided to its members, and some of the\\nsubstance of the report and recommendations. These groups support strong, vigorous enforcement\\nof existing DOE guidance and were concerned that the CJS work could be wrongly used to weaken\\nit. As a result of this opposition, CJS withdrew its resolution from consideration by the ABA House\\nof Delegates. Accordingly, the report and recommendations were not approved by the ABA House\\nof Delegates and thus are not the policy of the ABA.\\nSecond, the Criminal Justice Section did not establish a task force of lawyers from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiverse\\nbackground and varying perspectives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It set up a task force to look at the issue from a criminal\\njustice standpoint. When the Section of Civil Rights and Social Justice and the Commission on\\nDomestic and Sexual Violence learned about the task force, they asked to participate so that the task\\nforce could hear views from a civil rights perspective. After all, Title IX is a civil rights statute \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nnot a criminal statute. CJS allowed one liaison from each group to participate. Those liaisons were\\nnot allowed to share the workings of the task force with the groups who sent them until CJS had\\nfinished its work. Thus, the entities had no opportunity to provide input or feedback during the\\nprocess.\\nAfter seeing and objecting to multiple parts of t...  \n",

       "8276   b\"Dear Secretary DeVos,\\nI am writing you as a citizen who has been working in the field of sexual violence for nearly a\\ndecade and as someone who works for an academic institution on Title IX issues daily (these\\nare my personal comments don't represent my institution). I have worked on the response side\\nas well as on the prevention side of this issue. As a campus administrator I first feel it is\\nimportant that you know that myself and many of my colleagues have been grateful for the\\nofficial guidance documents published on Title IX over the last few years, as they spoke to and\\naddressed many of the questions we had concerning compliance and provided us with a\\nframework to assist in implementing and further developing institutional practices and\\nprocedures. In fact, since 2015 I have seen a huge benefit to our institution and our students\\nand staff because we have implemented many changes based on the guidance documents. Our\\nstudents trust our institution more than ever to keep them safe and to provide them with\\nknowledge and support if they find themselves involved with a Title IX investigation. This was\\nnot the case before 2015.\\nI agree with you that largely we do have a failed system, but I sincerely believe that the system\\nhas always been a failed system. Since 2015 we have made positive changes in the right\\ndirection. We still have a lot of work to do to make the system work well, but not enforcing these\\ndocuments will do way more harm than help. It is only because of those documents that we\\neven ever found out that the system is failed. Because without those documents and the last\\nadministration's focus on ensuring students were made aware of their rights, most if not all\\nstudents would never have even known that they could file a complaint, that they had rights that\\ntheir institution had to uphold, that there was anything to be done about\\nharassment/discrimination/sexual misconduct.\\nIn your speech, all of your examples illustrate that institutions were not following the law or\\nabiding by OCR guidance - they don't illuminate how OCR guidance is wrong or failing. OCR\\nguidance tells us students should not feel they have to go the process alone, it states\\ninstitutions must enforce due process rights, it states we must get adequate training to do our\\njobs. OCR guidance documents clearly outline that Title IX investigations need to be balanced,\\nimpartial, and fair, providing the same opportunities to both parties.\\nYes, Title IX and OCR guidance documents do not require that an appeal process is provided;\\nhowever, an appeals process is recommended under OCR guidance documents. This small\\nchange from a recommendation to a requirement would be easy to accomplish. I would also\\nsuggest ensuring that if one party has legal representation that the other party is given access\\nto legal representation as well.\\nYou discuss the fact that there is a need for a more precise definition of sexual misconduct.\\nHowever, I would say that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a more precise definition of sexual misconduct itself,\\nwhat we probably do need to have a discussion about is the definitions for various forms of\\nsexual misconduct (sexual assault/rape/domestic violence/stalking). Indeed my own colleagues\\nand I have been discussing this for the last two years. Clery uses one set of definitions put forth\\n\\n\\x0cby the FBI, states put forth their own definitions in state code and often these definitions are not\\nthe same.\\nYou similarly spoke of faculty or students being punished for free speech. Under OCR guidance\\nit has been clear that free speech is protected, and that institutional responsibility to protect\\nstudents from discrimination must be done while respecting free-speech rights.\\nAll in all your problem is with institutions that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t follow OCR guidance nor best practices in\\nthe field. This is an incredibly complex field, one in which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working in and studying for\\nalmost a decade. There is no simple answer. However, if we are committed to continuing to do\\nresearch, to establish and implement best practices then we will be on the right side of this\\nnational conversation. I hope that you join me in my commitment to implementing best practices\\nin this field. Yes, we can improve OCR guidance. We should improve it as we learn more about\\nwhat is best practice. We should not go backward and get rid of everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked for. As\\nthe head of the DOE, I hope you stay committed to helping institutions across this country\\nimplement best practices on their campuses.\\nI appreciate your comments in your speech about testing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cideas with those who know this issue\\nall too well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Professionals in this field, myself included, should certainly have a seat at the table.\\nI urge you to follow through with these statements and am more than happy to contribute to\\nthese conversations.\\nThanks for your time and consideration,\\nSteph...  \n",

       "8321   b'Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\\nThe \"Dear Colleague Letter and Resource Guide on ADHD\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhttps:// www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201607-504adhd.pdf\\nAs a concerned citizen, I want to raise a few points on why I object to the removal of\\n\"Dear Colleague Letter and Resource Guide on ADHD.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Broadly, the early\\nidentification of ADHD promoted through this guidance has substantial benefits for\\nour society. I hope to illustrate through my personal story that the guidance is\\nhelpful, necessary, and should remain in place.\\nAs an adult recently diagnosed with ADHD at age 30, I can look back and see many\\nADHD related struggles I had in K-12. I can also see the continuation of those\\nstruggles in college, in my career, and in my personal life. If the mission of\\nmandatory education in the United States is to prepare individuals to be productive,\\ncontributing members of our society, shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we make an effort to identify\\nneurodiversity so the affected individuals can maximize their abilities? Having\\nguidelines in place that make it easier for teachers and parents to give ADHD\\nstudents the support that will help them to succeed in an evidence-based, effective\\nmanner. The rights of students to access to support without guidelines could result\\nin waste of money, time, and effort on the part of educators and students who need\\nto know what effective support for this disorder means.\\nThe diagnosis of ADHD is life-changing information. One of the most common issues\\nthat adults with ADHD have upon diagnosis is mourning the life that could have\\nbeen. Time management problems, distractibility, focusing on something that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nthe most important part of a project, and chronic procrastination are examples of\\nneurologically driven behaviors for people with ADHD. This can lead to poor\\nperformance in school and in the work place. Adults with ADHD have lived decades\\nthinking they were lazy, lacking in motivation to pursue their dreams and talents,\\nthat they were irresponsible people. Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can lead to\\nfurther mental health issues including depression and anxiety. These additional\\ndisorders are a drain on our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collective productivity. A major cause of these\\nsecondary disorders appear to be repeated failures to accomplish activities that the\\nADHD makes difficult while comparing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self to neurotypical individuals who\\nhave no problem accomplishing the same tasks. With the early knowledge of these\\nweaknesses, a student and later a member of the US workforce can set up systems to\\nmitigate these issues and avoid developing additional mental health issues.\\nAs a gifted student with inattentive ADHD, it is unsurprising that my teachers\\nmissed the signs of my disorder given the stereotypical description of an ADHD kid\\nas a physically out of control boy. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t loud; I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a distraction to other\\nstudents in class. While I daydreamed in school, I was smart enough to put together\\nthe bits and pieces I had paid attention to in order to give the right answer in class\\nmost of the time. But I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ok. The emotional dysregulation aspect of ADHD made\\nembarrassing moments debilitating. Feeling angry, frustrated, or even excited\\n\\n\\x0cwould kill any chance of my learning from the teacher that day. The negative\\nconsequences of strong feelings for the rest of my cognitive capacities had me\\npulling back and avoiding relationships that could potentially cause those feelings.\\nIndividuals who take the opposite tack, as many ADHD individuals do, sacrifice\\neducational attainment while prioritizing building close relationships. Identification\\nwould allow students, teachers, and parents understand the sources of difficulty,\\nallowing them to be addressed.\\nAs a woman who holds a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in a STEM field and will soon hold a\\ndoctorate, I am among the educational elite. Individuals like me lead our society.\\n(https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-raise-a-genius-lessons-froma-45-year-study-of-supersmart-children/) Have I done pretty well in life? Yes.\\nCould I have done better? Yes to that as well. Personally, unstructured work at the\\nend of my doctorate has been an insurmountable challenge without knowledge of\\nADHD. I have lost years of productivity. With the diagnosis and my own discovery of\\nthe research on accommodations for adults I will work around my challenges and\\nfinish my degree this year. I am confident my diagnosis will lead me to doing more\\nfor society than I would have if I failed out of my doctorate program.\\nAs the guidance letter discusses, without the guidance schools had frequently used\\nhigh performance in school as an indicator that a student does not have ADHD or at\\nleast doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need support for their ADHD. This is simply inaccurate. There is\\nregular rhetoric in this country that we value innovatio...  \n",

We have spent years researching and advocating for changes to\\nthe laws and practices that push students out of their schools through the use\\nof punitive discipline and the criminalization of school behaviors.\\nWe believe all children deserve a great education and to feel safe and\\nwelcomed in their classrooms. When a school or a school district doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntreat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws require the\\nDepartment of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools\\nunderstand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone\\nunderstands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and\\nguidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law.\\nI support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students\\nreceive the protections and supports they deserve.\\nOur education system is unfair to many students and communities. Students\\nwho are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants,\\nEnglish learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many\\nbarriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to\\nchange that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they\\ndeserve. Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them.\\nWe oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and\\nguidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws. We have relied\\non guidance related to school police, school discipline, and the exclusion of\\nyoung children from their classrooms. We use these tools to advocate for\\nimportant policy changes at the school district and state levels, including a\\nrecent statewide ban on out-of-school suspensions for pre-K through second\\ngraders.

       "8331   b'September 20, 2017\\nThe Honorable Betsy DeVos\\nSecretary\\nU.S. Department of Education\\n400 Maryland Ave., SW\\nWashington, D.C. 20002\\nRE: Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\\nDear Secretary DeVos:\\nI write to you today to implore you to keep all Title IX rules and regulations in\\nplace, especially those which apply to athletics. These regulations are crucial to\\nproviding access to sports girls of the US.\\nAs evident through Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sports Foundation research, sports provide its\\nparticipants with lifelong benefits (Staurowsky, 2015). Certainly, health is often\\nimproved when an individual participates, but there are other, often less\\ntangible benefits that are earned through a sports experience. Benefits include\\nleadership, workplace advancement, educational achievement, time\\nmanagement, and team work. It is in our best interest as a country to ensure\\nthat such benefits are extended equitably to the women of the United States.\\nNow that we are decades into Title IX\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementation, we can see first-hand\\nthe strong women who have benefitted from a sports experience and gone on\\nto become successful and contributing members of our society, including\\ndoctors, lawyers, politicians, and corporate leaders.\\nIn 1971, a young girl in Connecticut sued for the right to join the boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 crosscountry team, as her school did not have a team for girls. In his decision, the\\njudge asserted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAthletic competition builds character in our boys. We do not\\nneed that kind of character in our girls, the women of tomorrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as cited in\\nBlumenthal, 2005). Times have changed since that 1971 judicial decision. Our\\ncountry is a better more prosperous place because women and girls can now\\naccess sports in our schools. In fact, labor economist Betsey Stevenson used\\nTitle IX as a natural experiment to examine the effect of Title IX on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\neducation and employment. The results are astounding and prove the need for\\nall of our children to have\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHigh school athletics confer substantial economic benefits that last\\nthroughout participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives. When one compares people with similar\\neducational opportunities, family backgrounds, measures of intelligence\\nand self-esteem, the annual wages of former athletes are, on average, 7\\npercent higher than nonathletes. Similarly, athletes get almost half a\\nyear more education than nonathletes. The gains occur equally for girls\\nand boys\\xe2\\x80\\xa6In those states where Title IX led to the greatest expansion in\\nfemale sports, the post-Title IX generation of women enjoyed more\\neducation, employment and higher wages than their pre-Title IX\\nforebears. They were also more likely to enter previously maledominated professions such as law, accounting and even\\nsports.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d(Stevenson & Wolfers, 2012)\\nThe passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has prompted\\nexponential growth in girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to school sports opportunities.\\nIn 1971-72, girls received less than 300,000 high school sports opportunities\\nand 30,000 collegiate sports opportunities (NFHS, 2016; NCAA, 2016). That\\nnumber has since skyrocketed to more than 3.3 million participants in high\\nschool and nearly 215,000 participants in college (NFHS, 2016; NCAA, 2016).\\nWhile there is pride to take in the progress made, we must not forget that\\ninequities still persist. Though high school girls have made great strides, high\\nschool female athletes in 2015-16 have yet to reach the level of boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pre-Title\\nIX participation numbers and they lag behind their male counterparts in current\\nparticipation rates by more than 1.2 million fewer opportunities (NFHS, 2016).\\nHowever, this is not for lack of interest. Girls across the country have proven\\ntime and time again that they are interested in sports. In fact, girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 HS\\nparticipation has increased every year since the 1988-89 school year (NFHS,\\n2016). Not only do participation inequities exist when looking at the country as\\na whole, we see that girls of color are doubly hit by race and gender. An\\nanalysis by the National Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Law Center illustrates this disparity faced by\\ngirls of color, finding that heavily minority schools have fewer sports offerings\\nthan heavily white schools and 40 percent of heavily minority schools versus 16\\npercent of heavily white schools, have large gaps between girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 representation\\nin student body versus their proportional representation in the athletic body.\\nThe existing regulations of Title IX, including the three-part test for\\nparticipation, ensure that our schools have concrete and tangible ways to\\n2\\n\\n\\x0ccomply with the law. These regulations are essential for ensuring we move\\ntowards equity and unleash the full potential of our children. Title IX has done\\ngreat things for our society but inequities persist for our girls. The current rules\\n...  \n",

       "8339   b'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\n\\nContacts:\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2017\\n\\nAnita B. Hoge, PA: 724-263-0474\\nAlice Linahan, TX: 972-322-8313\\nKaren Bracken, TN: 215-692-2147\\nLynne Taylor, NC: 704-517-3481\\n\\nAustin, Texas, September 20, 2017. Citizens across the United States are prepared to\\nwage an aggressive grassroots effort to stop The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\\nbecause it promotes Child Abuse in the Classroom. Parents and citizens across the United\\nStates are requesting an immediate injunction to stop the implementation of social, emotional,\\nand behavioral standards and interventions that have been codified in the Every Student\\nSucceeds Act (ESSA) passed and signed into law in December of 2015. Although the\\nimplementation of these non-academic standards and interventions have been previously\\napproved and funded by former President Obama through the Executive Order 12866 and the\\nillegal ESEA Flexibility Waivers, Congress has not stopped the progressive execution of these\\nexperimental, psychological manipulations in the classrooms of America. Because our children\\nare at-risk of abuse, we are calling for an immediate investigation!\\nThe Chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander, had purposely eliminated any\\nreference in his summary reports that would disclose the illegal and dangerous psychological\\ntechniques codified in his ESSA education legislation. Citizens know that Senator Alexander had\\nbeen informed of the abusive mental health interventions that he permitted to be incorporated\\ninto his legislation. We are asking that he publicly recant the language in his bill that opened the\\ndoor to these abuses. We request his immediate resignation if he fails to act forthrightly to\\nremedy this critical situation.\\nPresident Trump has written and released an Executive Order that directs Secretary of\\nEducation DeVos to Enforce Statutory Prohibitions on Federal Control of Education. The Every\\nStudent Succeeds Act legislation violates the protection and safety of our children. This Act\\nrequires the use of abusive psychological techniques on children. These techniques are actually\\ncodified into this law. We request that Secretary DeVos immediately prohibit the use of intrusive\\npsychological and behavioral techniques named in the legislation on America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s children in\\nAmerican classrooms. The Intervention techniques specifically named in the legislation include:\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cApplied Behavior Analysis posing as positive behavior intervention and supports; multi-tiered\\nsystem of supports (response to intervention); school-wide tiered system of supports;\\nspecialized instructional support services; early intervening services for at-risk children or those\\nwho may be at-risk for mental health disabilities; and universal design for learning.\\nThe following list of American citizen and parent grievances explains the wrong-doing through\\nexperimental research and psychological abuse that is currently being done to children in the\\nclassrooms across America:\\nEvery Student Succeeds Act violates the privacy of our children and families. Our children\\nare not a commodity. Currently businesses, corporations, and higher education are able to\\ncommercialize personally identifiable information (PII) into an invisible (to citizenry) lucrative\\nempire obtained by secretly data-mining information through discreet memorandums of\\nunderstanding. This is not only highly unethical but a violation of student and family privacy.\\nEvery Student Succeeds Act violates our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s families\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Constitutional protections,\\nspecifically the 1st and 4th Amendments, and the Civil Rights of students that protect them\\nfrom invasive psychological experimentation techniques and manipulative mind-bending\\nmethods.\\nEvery Student Succeeds Act violates the personal liberties of our children through the illegal\\ndata collection of their psychological data, including the use of controversial techniques that\\nmanipulate their attitudes, values, beliefs, and dispositions. This private information collected\\non your vulnerable child is going into every state longitudinal data system and beyond. Data\\non our children is entered at the local level, thus creating a psychometric dossier that is\\ndigitally transferred to the Institute for Educational Sciences, a formidable ersatz national\\nschool board. Each child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personally identifiable information (PII) is transferred and redisclosed to third parties. Parents are not properly informed because this privacy-invading\\nprocess does not require parental permission.\\nEvery Student Succeeds Act violates a student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freedom of conscience and religious\\nfreedom via the behavioral and affective molding of their minds by controversial concepts\\ncalled the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhole child.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Parents have NOT been provided access to critical information about\\nthe full purposes, exact definitions, and algorithms.

We strongly believe that all students deserve\\nand are entitled to a quality education in an environment free of violence. Unfortunately, this is not a\\nreality for many students with marginalized identities, especially students who identify as people of color,\\nLGBTQ, immigrants, and Muslims. When a school or school district perpetrates or allows violence, civil\\nrights laws require the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand\\nwhat the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have,\\nregulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We\\nfully support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections\\nand supports they deserve. Which is why, we oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace\\nregulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\\nThrough our community work, we know firsthand that LGBTQ students face extensive barriers to\\neducational success. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report that\\nfound 17.8% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students have been forced to have sexual\\nintercourse compared to 5.4% of heterosexual high school students.1 The largest national survey\\nexamining the experiences of transgender people in the U.S. found that 13% of respondents who were out\\nor perceived as transgender in K-12 were sexually assaulted because of their gender identity.2 This same\\nreport also found that 54% of Transgender K-12 students have experienced verbal harassment, and 24%\\nwere physically attacked. This violence and mistreatment was so pervasive that 17% of transgender\\nstudents left a K-12 school, and 6% were expelled.2 For transgender individuals who continued onto\\ncollege or vocation school, 24% experienced verbal, physical, or sexual harassment during their high\\neducation experience.2 The 2015 AAU Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct\\ndetermined that 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, and non-conforming) college students have\\nbeen sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN females, and 4% of non-TGQN males. Any\\nrollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of\\nLGBTQ student survivors, making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they\\nexperience their school environments.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Department of Education\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job to help our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s schools provide high-quality education for all\\nstudents. We urge you not to roll back these protections.\\nSincerely,\\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs\\n\\n1\\n\\nKann, L., Olsen, E.O., McManus, T., Harris, W.A., Shanklin, S.L., Flint, K.H. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Zaza, S.

       "15303  b'August 21, 2017\\nTo Whom It May Concern:\\nThe Missouri School Boards\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Association is a non-profit organization created by public school board\\nmembers to provide assistance to and to advocate on behalf of Missouri public schools.\\nApproximately 400 school districts are members of MSBA. On behalf of MSBA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s member school\\ndistricts, MSBA submits the following recommendations regarding U.S. Department of Education\\nguidance or regulations:\\n1. Eliminate the FAPE and Special Education Requirements in Section 504 Regulations:\\n34 CFR 104.33 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 104.37.\\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAct\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) has been interpreted by the\\nU.S. Department of Education as requiring districts to provide students a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree and appropriate\\npublic education,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also known as FAPE. 34 CFR 104.33. This regulation goes far beyond what the\\nenacting statute requires, has created confusion regarding a school district\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obligations to students\\nwho are disabled but who do not qualify for special education under the Individuals with Disabilities\\nEducation Act, and have expanded the legal liability of public school districts.\\nThe Act never uses the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree and appropriate public education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it is unclear where this term\\noriginated. MSBA is particularly concerned about the definition of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAppropriate education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nregulations, which requires districts to provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregular or special education and related aids and\\nservices . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 34 CFR 104.33(b(emphasis added). The requirement to provide special education is\\nnot mentioned at all in the Act either. The Act does not require that governmental entities create\\nnew, specialized programs for persons with disabilities. Instead, it prohibits governmental entities\\nfrom excluding persons with disabilities form existing programs or activities.\\nYet the U.S. Department of Education has independently created through these regulations a\\nrequirement for school districts to identify students with disabilities, formally evaluate the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndisability, create \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the student, reevaluate the student, and provide the student\\nprocedural safeguards. 34 CFR 104.33 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 104.37. These obligations go far beyond what was\\nauthorized by the Act, which was to merely provide access to persons with disabilities to existing\\nprograms and services.\\nThese regulations are long overdue for review and revision. The regulations were initially enacted in\\n1980. Aligning the regulations with the enacting statute will provide a more legally sound\\ninterpretation and clarify district obligations under the Act, making it easier for districts to comply\\nand for the Office for Civil Rights to monitor compliance. Further, eliminating reference to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial\\neducation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the process for supplying such education in these regulations will not harm students.\\nA student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to special education is already fully authorized under the Individuals with\\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) and regulations interpreting IDEA.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c2. Revise Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Regulations to Specifically\\nAddress Video Recordings: 34 CFR Part 99\\nVideo recording has become ubiquitous in public school districts. Security cameras are installed in\\nbuildings and on buses. School events such as graduation, music concerts, and athletic events are\\nfrequently recorded. Video is incorporated into lessons and many schools now offer media courses\\nor even host television channels for students. Teachers and administrators include images on district\\nwebsites and in social media. Professional staff even recorded while teaching in the classroom for\\nprofessional development and evaluation purposes. Yet the U.S. Department of Education has yet to\\nadopt specific regulations or guidance interpreting FERPA with the unique issues involved with\\nvideo recording, leaving districts to guess how the Department would apply the regulations.\\nMSBA encourages the Department to review and revise the FERPA Regulations to provide more\\nspecific guidance to school districts on when pictures of students caught on video recordings may be\\nreleased. Because the U.S. Department of Education enforces FERPA, guidance directly from the\\nDepartment is necessary. In particular, MSBA encourages the Department to create guidance to\\naddress the following scenarios:\\nExample 1: Two students get into a fight, which is recorded on a bus or building security camera.\\nThe recording is used as a disciplinary record for both students and both students are disciplined.\\nThe parents of each student demand to see the recordings. The district does not have the technology\\nor expertise to obscure the faces of one student so that the parents of the other student may view the\\nrecor...  \n",

For that reason and many more, we urge the Department of\\nEducation to maintain the current level of data collection from all schools and\\ndistricts and to consider enhancing data collection so that parents and students\\nhave all the information they need to advocate for themselves.\\nThe Department is proposing to change the 2017-2018 CRDC to reduce\\nthe burden on school districts. However, the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions will only\\nshift the burden onto parents and students and actually result in increased\\nburdens for school staff.\\nMany parents and students attempt to gather data on their own, but\\nthey often have a difficult time navigating the records request and production\\nprocess. The CRDC provides families with an easily accessible method of\\ngathering information about schools in their communities. Diluting this tool\\nwill have the clear, predictable, and discriminatory consequence of harming\\nstudents and parents in low-income communities and communities of color.\\nFamilies currently have one easily accessible source to read information\\nabout the schools in their neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x94CRDC\\xe2\\x80\\x94but if data is taken off the\\nsite, families will have to find other sources of information. Families with more\\ntime and resources will be able to fill the information gap, but low-income\\nfamilies and communities of color will not. This unjust and discriminatory\\nresult should be prevented.\\nMoreover, the Department of Education should consider ways to\\nenhance the data available on CRDC so that families can make decisions that\\nare more informed. In particular, CRDC should collect and release more data:\\n1. For the LGBTQ community, English-Learners, foster youth, homeless\\nyouth, students with disabilities, and other students in our school system\\nthat may have unique needs.\\n2. On the impact of school security/police on students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 well-being and safety.\\n3. On the reasons why students are disciplined, with a particular focus on the\\nuse of willful defiance/disruption.\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c4. On the use of alternatives to exclusionary discipline, such as Restorative\\nJustice and Positive Behavior and Intervention Supports (PBIS).\\nThe Department of Education should also collect and release data on an\\nannual basis so that families have the most current data available to them.\\nData collection and review is also necessary for school staff to learn what\\nis going well in their schools, what is not, and what other schools they can\\ncontact to learn from. Thus, reducing the level of data collection for CRDC will\\nactually result in the opposite intended effect in the long-term\\xe2\\x80\\x94it will increase\\nthe burden on many schools because they will not have sufficient information\\nfor effective planning and problem-solving.\\nFor the aforementioned reasons, we urge the Department of Education\\nto maintain the current level of data collection and consider enhancing the Civil\\nRights Data Collection with the above-listed recommendations.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nRuth Cusick\\nSenior Staff Attorney\\n\\nAnabel Agloro\\nStaff Attorney\\n\\nOscar Daniel Lopez\\nStaff Attorney\\n\\n\\x0c'  \n",

This practice is required by the\\nAdministrative Procedure Act. It is also sensible policy. Department policies on Title IX\\naffect thousands of schools and millions of students, staff, and faculty. Ensuring public\\nparticipation and the airing of views is critical. If department statements are not binding,\\nbut merely tentative announcements of Department positions, then they ought not be\\ntreated as legal obligations by the agency during investigation or enforcement\\nproceedings. The law clearly requires this as well.\\n(2) During compliance investigations, Department staff should not coerce schools into\\nadopting policies and procedures that exceed any existing federal legal obligations. The\\nthreat of losing federal funds ought not be used to change primary behavior if it is not\\nrequired by existing statutes, regulations, or judicial interpretation.\\n(3) School policies and process should seek to protect the rights of complainants and\\naccused, irrespective of sex or gender.\\nIf I can provide any additional information, I would be delighted to do so.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJacob E.

Council Education Committee members are former students who received special\\neducation services, parents of students with disabilities, special education teachers, school\\nadministrators, staff from the Department of Education & Early Development (EED) and others involved\\nin the education of students with disabilities. The Council Education Committee works on issues and\\nactivities of concern to make changes in the education system that improve the lives of students with\\ndisabilities.\\nOn June 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) published a Federal Register\\nnotice that it is seeking public input regarding regulations or guidance to be repealed, replaced or\\nmodified. The Department is particularly interested in regulatory provisions that members of the public\\nfind unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome. The Department also published the first progress\\nreport of its Regulatory Reform Task Force, which was formed pursuant to a February 2017 presidential\\nexecutive order requiring federal agencies to create such task forces to evaluate existing regulations for\\npotential repeal, replacement or modification. Comments in response to the Federal Register notice\\nmust be submitted no later than August 21, 2017.\\nIn the progress report, the task force identified more than 150 regulations and a total of 1,772 items of\\npolicy-related guidance to be reviewed. As a next step, the task force is requiring offices within the\\nDepartment, including the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), to recommend regulations to be\\nrepealed, replaced or modified. The task force also announced that it plans to meet with major\\nconstituencies and stakeholder groups, including some major higher education association groups to\\nseek their input. The task force further intends to facilitate discussions on these issues at conferences\\nand meetings.\\nThe Council Education Committee recognizes the value of cost containment and simplified regulations,\\nas a general goal. However, the IDEA regulations form a unified, comprehensive scheme with\\ninterdependent sections. Removing or modifying sections of these regulations in a piecemeal fashion\\nrisks causing unintended impacts to other related sections of the regulations, which could in turn\\nadversely affect the education of children with disabilities. Even small changes to the IDEA regulations\\nmay result in increased disputes and litigation between parents and school districts due to the impact of\\nthose changes. Initially, the IDEA regulations resulted in a large number of due process hearings across\\nthe country, as school districts and families sought clarification and correct application of the\\nregulations. As the rights of students and parents under the IDEA have become clarified, the number of\\ndue process hearings in most states has decreased significantly. The potential cost savings proposed by\\nnew changes to the regulations must be weighed against the possible expense of new disputes that may\\narise from altering rights that are currently settled under the existing regulations. The Council Education\\nCommittee cautions the Department to avoid piecemeal amendments to the IDEA regulations that could\\nresult in confusion about procedures and rights under the IDEA, increased due process hearings, and\\ndecreased educational opportunity for children with disabilities.\\n\\nPage 1 of 1\\n\\n\\x0c'  \n",

       "15330  b'Comments: Howard Community College, OPEID 00817500\\nDocket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\\nHoward Community College (HCC) welcomes this opportunity to comment on whether Title IV\\npostsecondary education regulations should be repealed, modified, or replaced. HCC is located in\\nColumbia Maryland. We enrolled 14,467 credit students in FY2016 and 15,571 noncredit continuing\\neducation students. Almost a quarter of graduating seniors from Howard County high schools in 2016\\nenrolled at HCC in Fall 2016, and 42% of undergraduate students living in the county attend HCC. The\\naverage age of our student is 26 years old and 37% of our students enroll fulltime. Forty-eight percent\\n(48%) of fall 2016 credit students received financial aid during their enrollment at HCC. Seventy-one\\npercent (71%) of our aid recipients are Pell Grant students. Thirty percent (30%) of our aid recipients\\nborrowed from the student loan programs, which is 10% of our enrolled students.\\nWe concur with the comments submitted by the American Association of Community Colleges, and\\nwould like to emphasize a few of the points made by AACC in the comments below.\\nProgram Integrity: Gainful Employment Regulations\\nWe are pleased that ED has already undertaken the process to reopen negotiated rulemaking\\nproceedings to modify the gainful employment (GE) regulations. We agree with the basic approach to\\ncreate GE eligibility metrics for individual GE programs, which show whether students who complete GE\\nprograms are subsequently able to repay their student loans without undue burden in a reasonable time\\nperiod. Our understanding is that the vast majority of community college GE programs were never in\\nany danger of failing the debt-to-earnings metric (and none did). Howard Community College has 27\\nGE programs, and only one program had earnings published (verified student count of 17 with median\\nearnings of $60,704 and mean earnings of $58,273) and no programs had a sufficient number of\\nborrowers for a debt to earnings ratio to be published. The cost of implementing the GE regulations is\\nenormous, involving staff across many academic and administrative office, and there was no benefit to\\nour students.\\nWe recommend that the GE regulations should exempt institutions and/or programs that have a history\\nof low borrowing. Most community colleges have well below 50% of their students borrowing federal\\nloans. Only about 10% of HCC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enrolled students borrow from the loan program, and even far less\\nthan that percentage of students who are enrolled specifically in the GE programs. Therefore we\\nrecommend that our GE programs should be exempted from the current GE reporting regulations and\\nany new GE regulations, other than some basic program disclosures referred to below.\\nAdditionally, we agree with AACC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recommendation that a minimum threshold be set for the number of\\nTitle IV students enrolled in the program in order to require reporting on GE programs to align with\\nconfidentiality and other rules. This includes almost all of HCC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GE programs.\\nReturn of Title IV Funds:\\nThese regulations are the most complex of the Title IV regulations and they are the most difficult to\\nimplement in a community college. The complexity of these regulations basically requires that these\\ncalculations be done manually. The complexity is not in the math, but in the gathering of the correct\\nenrollment data for the calculation. The reason why this area remains one of the top 3 findings in\\nprogram reviews and audits for the past decade is not because colleges do not put the time and effort\\n\\n\\x0cinto complying, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too complex to automate and too complex to be able to reliably do a\\nmanual calculation for hundreds of students each term. HCC has surveyed other community colleges\\nand on average, it takes about 30 minutes per withdrawn student to complete the r2t4 calculation\\nprocess from start to finish. The ACE report proposes modifications to several provisions of these\\nregulations to ease the burden of compliance.\\nVerification and ISIR Comment Codes:\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the highest need students, Pell eligible applicants, who are most subject to having to gather\\nadditional documentation to validate the information they submitted on the FAFSA. This occurs as a\\npart of the verification process and also through various comment codes assigned by the U.S.\\nDepartment of Education on the ISIR. Simplifying the FAFSA but increasing the complexity of the\\ndocumentation required to complete the file does not improve access for high need students. We\\nrecommend that the simplification approach be also applied on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cback end\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to make it easier for\\nstudents to complete their financial aid file. One critical issue that we hope doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t occur again is the\\nshutdown of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA.\\nThank you for your consideration of these comments. If you ...  \n",

SSWAA promotes the profession of school social work to enhance social-emotional\\ngrowth and positive mental health, behavioral, and academic outcomes of all students. We support school\\nsocial work as a valued, integral part of the education of all children, connecting schools, families and\\ncommunities.\\nSchool social workers are conversant with and work under most federal laws governing elementary and\\nsecondary education. We are particularly interested in regulations implementing the Individuals with\\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). We focus on the impact\\nof the laws and accompanying regulations on students' ability to access and receive school-based mental\\nhealth services from qualified school-employed mental health professionals, including school social\\nworkers, to ensure academic success for all students. We also work through those laws to ensure a\\npositive school learning environment for all students.\\nGenerally seen as a civil rights statute, the IDEA ensures a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in\\nthe least restrictive environment (LRE) for all eligible children and youth with disabilities. It is a complex\\neducation law, and the accompanying regulations are comprehensive and closely aligned with the\\nstatutory language. The law gives families the right to participate in the development of an individualized\\neducation program (IEP) and due process rights to enforce FAPE, LRE, and other critical provisions of\\nthe law. Strong implementation of the IDEA, based on both the statute and the regulations, has been\\ncritical in helping students with disabilities, including those with mental health needs, advance\\nacademically and in providing their families full partnership in educational decisions for their children.\\nA broad array of stakeholders provided extensive comments to and engaged intensively with the\\nDepartment of Education on the current IDEA regulations. The Department issued regulations that mirror\\nthe law in many instances and clarify certain statutory provisions to assist school districts in implementing\\nthe law fairly and appropriately. These regulations also help families understand what services and\\n\\nTel/Fax: 202.686.1637 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 www.sswaa.org\\n\\n\\x0csupports are available to their children and how they can be accessed. SSWAA believes any changes to\\nthese regulations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 repeal, replacement, or modification \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should not be undertaken without considering\\nthe full context of the law. Therefore, SSWAA does not support changing current IDEA regulations in any\\nmanner at this time.\\nIn addition, school social workers are part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) as school-based\\nmental health providers, working closely with the four designated student subgroups and their families.\\nWe have already seen the repeal of accountability regulations promulgated shortly after the law was\\npassed before these regulations were allowed to go into effect. School districts need clarity and stability\\nas they move forward to implement this new law fully in the next school year. Any further changes at this\\ntime will affect longstanding plans by states to effectively transition to ESSA.

LDA \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a national volunteer organization representing\\nindividuals with learning disabilities, their families, and the professionals who serve them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has\\nworked for more than 40 years to ensure children with specific learning disabilities are properly\\nidentified and receive appropriate services to enable them to fully benefit from these educational\\nopportunities, graduate from high school, and meet their postsecondary goals.\\nChildren and youth with learning disabilities benefit from effective implementation of all federal laws\\ngoverning elementary and secondary education, as well as those addressing postsecondary training\\nand higher education. We are particularly interested in regulations related to the Individuals with\\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA), which ensures a free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the\\nleast restrictive environment (LRE) for all eligible children and youth with learning disabilities.\\nThe IDEA is a complex education law, and the accompanying regulations are comprehensive and\\nclosely aligned with the statutory language. Generally acknowledged as a civil rights law, the IDEA\\nprovides families the right to participate in the development of a individualized education program\\n(IEP) and due process rights to enforce FAPE, LRE, and other critical provisions of the law. Strong\\nimplementation of the IDEA, based on both the statute and the regulations, has been critical in\\nhelping students with learning and other disabilities to advance academically, increasing high school\\ngraduation rates, and providing families with a voice in their children's education.\\nA broad array of stakeholders provided extensive comments to and engaged intensively with the\\nDepartment of Education on the current IDEA regulations. The Department chose to promulgate\\nregulations that mirror the law in many instances and clarify particular statutory provisions to assist\\nschool districts in implementing the law fairly and appropriately. These regulations also help families\\nto understand what services and supports are available to their children and how those educational\\ntools can be accessed. LDA believes any changes to these regulations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 repeal, replacement, or\\nmodification \\xe2\\x80\\x93 should not be undertaken without considering the full context of the law. Therefore,\\nLDA does not support changing current IDEA regulations in any manner at this time.\\n\\n\\x0cLDA \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Regulatory Reform\\nPage 2\\nIn addition, students with disabilities are a designated subgroup under the Every Student Succeeds\\nAct (ESSA). We have already seen the repeal of accountability regulations promulgated shortly after\\nthe law was passed before these regulations were allowed to go into effect. School districts need\\nclarity and stability as they move forward to implement this new law fully in the next school year.\\nAny further changes at this time will affect longstanding planning by states to effectively transition to\\nESSA. Therefore, LDA also recommends no further changes to ESSA regulations at this time.\\nLDA is always pleased to serve as a resource to the Department in regard to the education of children\\nand youth with learning disabilities.

This outcome is consistent with the discretion that the\\nSecretary has to establish and define appropriate employment outcomes.\\'\\nThe Homemaker Outcome had been considered a successful closure for the use of federal\\nVR funds for many years. It not only allows the individual to become personally and\\neconomically self-sufficient, it recognizes the critical role that homemakers fulfill in the\\nlocal and national economy. This is particularly important for individuals who are blind or\\nvisually impaired. Individuals who are blind rely on DSU\\'s/VR programs as a pathway\\ntowards achieving and/or regaining independence and economic self-sufficiency. Blind,\\nnewly blind and visually impaired individuals need to learn and master many skills that are\\nessential to success in the home and the workplace. They must master braille and/or other\\ninformation technology to access communication. They must learn and/or relearn basic\\nliving skills such as cooking, cleaning and home management. They must study and master\\nthe skills necessary to know where they are, how to get from place to place and how to\\nfunction in a home and work environment. A critical first step in achieving this goal is to\\nprovide VR training and support to enable the individual to effectively manage their home.\\nAchieving this level of self-sufficiency enables the individual to use those skills as a jumping\\noff point into the competitive labor market. Individuals are required to be served in\\nIndependent Living or Independent Living Older Blind programs with no increase in\\nprogram funding to support the additional clients and level of services offered under the\\nVR program. Many working age individuals do not qualify for independent living services\\nunder the Older Individuals with Blindness Program.2 Therefore, denying blind and visually\\nimpaired individuals of the opportunity to learn these skills deprives them of the\\nopportunity to build the foundation for success and self-sufficiency upon which success in\\na competitive workplace is based.\\n2.\\n\\nCompetitive Integrative Employment Regulation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 34 CFR \\xc2\\xa7 361.5(c)(9)\\nDSS/RSB urges the USDOE to review the Competitive Integrative Employment regulation to\\ngive states who support blind and visually impaired individuals the flexibility to implement\\na wide range of training and employment opportunities through VR program.

We work to improve public education by\\nstrengthening charter authorizing policies and practices.\\nThe charter school model is built on the premise that strong student outcomes are possible when\\nschools are granted increased autonomy over a range of operational and programmatic areas and, in\\nexchange, are subject to strong accountability. It is an authorizer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsibility to uphold this charter\\nbargain.\\nIn response to this Request for Comment, NACSA reviewed federal regulations and guidance documents\\nto identify policy areas that would benefit from re-examination. As you know, charter schools, just like all\\npublic schools, are subject to federal laws, regulations, and Department guidance. The majority of laws\\nand regulations apply to charter schools in exactly the same way as traditional public schools, while\\nsome regulations may apply slightly differently. A handful apply only to charter schools that receive\\nfederal Charter School Program grant funds. With this in mind we focused our review on regulations and\\nguidance that: (1) apply only to charter schools; (2) have an outsized impact on charter schools; and/or\\n(3) affect the ability of charter school authorizers to perform necessary oversight functions.\\nThe resulting comments, detailed on the following pages, are categorized by authorizing program and\\ninclude recommendations and our rationale for review. In some cases, we are encouraging the\\nDepartment to retain regulations or guidance that help authorizers perform necessary oversight\\nfunctions or protect charter schools from state or district overreach. We also plan to submit additional\\ndetailed comments pertaining to the non-regulatory guidance governing the Charter School Program in\\na separate letter.\\nThank you for your consideration. We look forward to continuing our work with the Department of\\nEducation and Congress to advance our shared goals. Please feel free to contact Amanda Fenton at\\namandaf@qualitycharters.org with any questions.\\nRegards,\\n\\nGreg Richmond\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nALL CHILDREN DESERVE A QUALITY EDUCATION.\\n\\n\\x0cRegulations and Guidance applying to the Charter\\nSchools Program\\nHelp Legacy Grantees Make Use of New Program Flexibilities\\nRelevant Citations:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\nNCLB Sec. 5202(d)(1)\\nNCLB Sec. 5204(f)(3)\\nNCLB Sec. 5204(f)(4)\\nCharter Schools Program, Title V, Part B of the ESEA Nonregulatory Guidance (issued January,\\n2014)\\n\\nDescription:\\nThe Charter School Program State Educational Agencies grant (CSP SEA) was eliminated and reimagined as the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools State Entity (State Entity) grant\\nprogram through the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). As a result, the CSP SEA grants exist only as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clegacy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grant program, administering funds to SEAs awarded grants in FY16 or earlier according to\\nprevious CSP SEA grant regulations and guidance. This cohort of legacy grantees includes more than a\\ndozen states that combined have charter sectors that serve more than two thirds of all charter school\\nstudents in the country. The impacted states have a long history of success growing high quality charter\\nschools, with ten of the impacted states recipients of back-to-back CSP grants for over eleven year.\\nWhen Congress re-imagined the CSP SEA program as the State Entity grant program through ESSA it\\nsignificantly improved many of the laws governing the program by increasing flexibility for state grantees\\nand for individual charter schools across several program areas. Under the new program states have\\nmuch more flexibility to expend funds to grow innovative, successful charter schools and to engage in\\nactivities that improve the performance of all charter schools across the state.\\nUnfortunately, under current Department policy, legacy grantees under the old program enjoy few of\\nthese benefits. Instead they are faced with a quixotic choice: go through the burdensome and\\nunpromising task of petitioning the Department for multiple individual program waivers to pursue\\nactivities that are already allowed for new grantees; or submit a separate application for a new grant\\nunder the State Entity program...  \n",

The U.S. Department of Education (ED) in the\\nnotice stated it was seeking input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement,\\nor modification. This is an extremely broad request and the very nature of it necessitated our\\ncomment on critical protections that we feel need to be maintained. Moreover, we request\\nfurther opportunity to provide comments to the extent to which ED is considering repealing or\\nmodifying any particular regulation.\\nIn general, Wisconsin strongly encourages ED to maintain regulations and guidance to support\\naccess and funding to public education, and to ensure each student graduates college and career\\nready. With that said, much of the rest of these comments will focus on the importance of the\\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and its accompanying regulations and\\nguidance materials.\\nIt is important to remind ourselves that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was\\noriginally enacted in 1975. It was then known as the Education for All Handicapped Children\\nAct. Prior to the enactment of this law, many children with disabilities were denied a public\\neducation and the opportunity to attend schools with their nondisabled peers. IDEA was enacted\\nso that all students with disabilities ages three through 21 are entitled to receive a free\\nappropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment through the\\ndevelopment of an individualized education program (IEP) designed to address the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndisability-related educational needs. The IDEA regulations also specify planning services and\\nsupports designed to specifically prepare the student for further education and competitive\\nemployment. Thus, IDEA not only provides students with disabilities access to education with\\ntheir peers, but helps prepares them for postsecondary success. The accompanying regulations to\\nthis law provide a level of specificity needed to ensure that state educational agencies, school\\ndistricts, and families have the assistance, mechanisms, and safeguards needed to effectively\\n\\nPO Box 7841, Madison, WI 53707-7841 \\xef\\x81\\xae 125 South Webster Street, Madison, WI 53703\\n(608) 266-3390 \\xef\\x81\\xae (800) 441-4563 toll free \\xef\\x81\\xae dpi.wi.gov\\n\\n\\x0cHilary Malawer\\nPage 2\\nAugust 22, 2017\\nenforce and implement this law. The regulations are vital in ensuring these opportunities for our\\nstudents with disabilities are not reduced.\\nIn addition, the Dear Colleague letters issued by the Office of Special Education Programs\\n(OSEP), provides clarification of IDEA requirements and supports our work as a state\\neducational agency and the work of our districts and other stakeholders. For example, the Dear\\nColleague Letter, dated November 16, 2015, directly supports our work around improving\\noutcomes for students with disability through the College and Career Ready (CCR) IEP\\nframework. The November 16 Dear Colleague letter emphasizes that a student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IEP must be\\ndeveloped with high expectations and that annual goals must be both ambitious and achievable\\nand aligned with rigorous grade-level content standards. This forms the basis for our CCR IEP\\nframework, which is designed to enrich IEP team discussion leading to the development of both\\ncompliant and results-driven IEPs. CCR IEPs build knowledge, skills, and habits throughout a\\nstudent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic experiences, so when they graduate, they are college and career ready. WDPI\\nhas revised its model IEPs as well as its monitoring system to align with this framework.\\nLikewise, the Dear Colleague letter issued on August 1, 2016 clarifies that as part of providing\\nFAPE to a student with a disability, the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavioral needs must be addressed through\\npositive supports, strategies, and interventions, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat incidents of child misbehavior or\\nclassroom disruptions, as well as violations of a code of student conduct, may indicate that the\\nstudent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IEP needs to include appropriate behavioral supports.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d WDPI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Positive Behavioral\\nIntervention and Supports system, as well as its guidance on functional behavioral assessments\\nand the development of behavioral intervention plans, are both supported by and strengthened by\\nthis Dear Colleague letter.\\nWhile all of th...  \n",
       "15443  b'Review and Proposed Solution to Harmonize the Abilityone Program with the\\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA) and Increase the\\nOpportunities for People who are Disabled and Small Business.\\n\\nPresented by Sachs Management, Inc.\\n2400 N. Lincoln Avenue\\nAltadena, CA 91001\\nTel: 626-344-7056\\nwww.sachsmanagement.com\\nssachs@sachsmanagement.com\\n\\nAugust 2017\\n\\n\\x0cPage: 1\\n\\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\\nAbilityOne (AB1) is the brand name of the program authorized by the Javits, Wagner,\\nO\\xe2\\x80\\x99Day (JWOD) Act, which was originally passed in 1938 and refreshed in 1971. The\\nintent of JWOD was to authorize a special preference in government contracting for\\nnonprofit sheltered workshops that train and employ people with disabilities. Nonprofits\\nmaintain their status in the program and the highest priority in federal contracting if they\\nprovide 75% of the direct labor on the products or services contracted for with people\\nwith disabilities. The program is broken into two sections- SourceAmerica (formerly the\\nNational Industries of Severely Handicapped), and the National Industries for the Blind\\nor (NIB) affiliates. Within the program, there are preferences for people who are blind for\\nsupplying products to the federal government, but that preference is second to the\\nFederal Prison Industries (FPI) (see FAR Part 8.6 and FAR Part 8.7 generally).\\nOnce a requirement is identified by AbilityOne for supply to the federal government, the\\nCentral Nonprofit Agencies (CNA) consisting of NIB and SourceAmerica, will work with\\nthe AbilityOne Commission (Commission) (formerly the Committee for the Purchase of\\nFrom People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled), to add the requirement to the\\nProcurement List. Following Administrative Procedure Act (APA) direction, a\\nrequirement is assessed for \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuitability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in accordance with the authorizing statutes by\\nthe Commission. The Commission has extraordinary discretion to determine the\\nsatisfaction of those suitability requirements (for instance no rule making has been done\\nto determine what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadverse impact on the incumbent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means, rather, it is a rule of\\nthumb determination by the Commission). Once the suitability is determined, the\\nCommission publishes its intent to add a requirement to the Procurement List in the\\nFederal Register. Upon the conclusion of the comment period, the Commission will\\nevaluate the comments, record of information from the affiliated CNA and nonprofit to\\ndetermine suitability. If suitability is deemed proper, the requirement is added to the\\nProcurement List. Thereafter, government buyers \\xe2\\x80\\x8bmust purchase items from the\\nProcurement List before using any other means of purchasing.\\nThe AB1 program has grown and changed significantly over the years. Currently,\\ngovernment customers spend over $3 billion to purchase products and services\\nprovided by nonprofits affiliated with NIB and SourceAmerica (based on the FY 2015\\nreport by the Commission, the last document recording overall program sales) making\\nthe program the largest employer of people with disabilities in the nation. Moreover, for\\nthe privilege of participating in the program, those nonprofits must pay a fee of just\\nunder 4% for all contract revenue to NIB and SourceAmerica (about $130 million\\nannually) for program \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmanagement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on behalf of the Commission.\\n\\n\\x0cPage: 2\\n\\nPrices charged to government customers are set by the Commission which is the\\nultimate arbiter of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prices, though in many cases, those prices are\\nsignificantly higher than otherwise found in the commercial marketplace. Justifying the\\nhigher prices, AB1 nonprofits claim the need to use disabled labor (more on that later),\\nwhich requires higher management and more oversight than commercial organizations\\nand with less productivity (one of the reasons AB1 nonprofits have used sub-minimum\\nwage labor as well due to productivity reductions).1\\nThe largest customer of AbilityOne nonprofits by far is the Department of Defense\\n(DOD). Reform for the program, which is in need of greater oversight, would be best\\nserved coming from the DOD and it is the intent of this paper to highlight many of the\\nissues with the program and how these issues can be addressed in a way that will not\\nharm those served by these programs. Rather, DOD can increase Competitive and\\nIntegrated (CI) opportunities for those in the program, and ultimately, increase\\ncompetition in a changing budget environment, allowing the DOD greater flexibility in\\nsourcing and how it meets its mission. It is obvious that if the reforms begin at DOD, the\\nsame benefits can be applied across the entire Federal Government which is required\\nto purchase items under JWOD with the same priorities afforded DOD customers.2\\nThe purpose of this document is to assist all stakeholders in meeting the changing\\nneeds of the program thro...  \n",

The P&A and CAP agencies were established by the United States\\nCongress to protect the rights of people with disabilities and their families through legal\\nsupport, advocacy, referral, and education. P&As and CAPs are in all 50 states, the\\nDistrict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam,\\nNorthern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands), and there is a P&A and CAP\\naffiliated with the Native American Consortium which includes the Hopi, Navajo and\\nSan Juan Southern Piute Nations in the Four Corners region of the Southwest.\\nCollectively, the 57 P&A and CAP agencies are the largest provider of legally based\\nadvocacy services to people with disabilities in the United States.\\nTwo critical areas of focus for the P&A/CAP agencies are education and vocational\\nrehabilitation.

The\\nCouncil of Administrators of Special Education (CASE) is an international professional educational\\norganization affiliated with the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) whose members are dedicated\\nto the enhancement of the worth, dignity, potential, and uniqueness of each individual in society.\\nCASE represents special education administrators in local school districts, the individuals charged with\\nresponsibility for implementation and financial oversight of special education programs for children\\nand youth with disabilities in schools across the country.\\nCASE is dedicated to high quality implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA).\\nIDEA is a comprehensive and complex law bolstered by regulations which are highly aligned with the\\nstatute. While CASE has specific areas of interest in recommending changes and improvements to\\nIDEA and the associated regulations, it is not appropriate or helpful to consider singular regulations for\\nrevision or reduction without considering the full context of the law. It is for these reasons that CASE\\ndoes not support any one regulation be altered or reduced at this time, but instead supports waiting\\nuntil reauthorization of the full law takes place to recommend these alterations.\\nIDEA serves an incredibly important role in supporting school and district leaders in ensuring high\\nquality and inclusive educational opportunities for students with disabilities. As leaders in the field of\\nspecial education we are highly sensitive to the interrelationship between each section of the law and\\nthe regulations that flow from it. There are several regulations under IDEA that have required\\nsignificant amounts of time to understand and implement. Recent regulations around significant\\ndisproportionality are a good example where implementation is presently just getting underway.\\n\\n\\x0cCASE \\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x93 Regulatory Reform\\nPage 2\\nWhile we understand the need to discuss efficiencies, effectiveness is of utmost importance in these\\ndiscussions. Reducing regulations will result in decreased efficiencies, creating greater complexity\\nand confusion if one or two regulations are changed without a full review of the law itself. CASE\\nsupports maintaining the IDEA regulations as currently written. Changes in regulation should not be\\npiecemeal and instead should be considered very carefully in the context of reauthorization.\\nThank you for the opportunity to provide input regarding the request for comments on the status of\\ncurrent education regulations. CASE would be happy to engage in further discussions and serve as a\\nresource on the IDEA.

This initial set of regulatory\\ncomments on the Every Student Succeeds Act\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (ESSA) final assessment regulations were\\npreviously submitted to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) based on a\\nMay 31 request for comments. Additionally, the Council now has included a few other\\ncomments on the June 30 IDEA final regulations (34 CFR 300) that replicate a number of the\\nESSA assessment regulations and appear to incorporate others by reference, specifically the\\noverly expansive ESSA translation regulations and the unauthorized ESSA regulatory\\nrequirement that every State establish a definition of students with the most significant\\ncognitive disabilities. These two additional comments can be found on pages 4 and 6 and are\\nnoted with an asterisk (*).\\nThe Council notes that many of the proposed ESSA rules developed by the Negotiated\\nRulemaking Committee have little or no basis in the Act and have now been incorporated by\\nreference into the IDEA final regulations. The result is unnecessary and unwarranted federal\\nrequirements for the development and implementation of ESSA-related assessments, as well as\\nin other areas not directly related to assessments. The Council requests that the Education\\nDepartment exercise the leadership and direction that were lacking during Negotiated\\nRulemaking, and revise the assessment regulations in direct conformity with the provisions of\\nthe Act.\\nMoreover, the Council disputes any thought that the final ESSA assessment regulations from\\nDecember 8, 2016 cannot be revised without reconvening a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee.\\nFirst, it is specious to assume that subsequent administrations could not undertake notice and\\ncomment rulemaking on any set of final regulations, particularly when it took some 14 years to\\ncomplete the last ESEA reauthorization. Second, the 2015 Neg Reg process appears to satisfy\\nthe ESSA section 1601 requirement for assessment regulations. And finally, the Secretary\\nretains clear statutory authority in section 1601(c) to determine that Neg Reg is unnecessary, or\\nthe Secretary could determine under section 1601(c)(3) that there is an emergency need to have\\nrevised assessment regulations prior to the spring 2018 state testing period.\\nThe following comments by the Council of the Great City Schools recommend revisions to the\\nESSA and IDEA assessment regulations, including the unauthorized requirement on the use of\\nthe ESSA 8th grade advanced math testing flexibility provision; the overregulation of provisions\\nrelated to alternative assessments and state waiver conditions; and several other overly\\nexpansive assessment regulations.\\n\\n\\x0cCouncil of the Great City Schools\\nComments on Existing Education Department Regulations\\nPage 2\\n\\nUnauthorized Regulatory Requirements to Utilize the 8th Grade Advanced\\nMath Testing Flexibility Provision under ESSA sec. 1111(b)(2)(C).\\nTo prevent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble testing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ESSA allows an 8th grade student enrolled in advanced math classes\\nto take a higher-level math assessment without being required also to take the regular 8th grade\\nstatewide math assessment. The assessment regulations [34 CFR 200.5(b)(4)], however, convert\\nthis narrow flexibility provision designed to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble testing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into a federal mandate for\\nstatewide strategies \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto provide all students in the State with the opportunity to be prepared for\\nand to take advanced mathematics coursework in middle school\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (emphasis added). In effect,\\nthis regulatory provision, drafted by the Department during negotiated rulemaking, imposes\\nmandatory State-level policies to provide any middle school student universal access to\\nprerequisite middle school advanced math coursework and to the advanced 8th grade math\\nassessment--if the State opts to use this ESSA flexibility. This rule regulates statewide\\ninstructional course offerings, in contrast to the ESSA statute, which solely addresses a math\\nassessment option.

The vast majority of our individual members are campus officials with direct responsibility for\\nadmissions, recruiting, academic records, and registration functions. Because they serve as custodians of\\neducation records for current and former students, our members are particularly knowledgeable about privacy\\nissues in general, and specifically about information security and privacy requirements of Federal and State\\nlaws. Compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) has long been a primary area\\nof professional jurisdiction for AACRAO members, who are often the leading FERPA experts on their\\ncampuses.\\nSince its original enactment in 1974, and through the numerous amendments, court decisions, and administrative\\npolicy revisions that have further refined that original construct over the years, AACRAO has been\\nconstructively engaged with the Department of Education to promote FERPA compliance and achieve the right\\nbalance between individual educational privacy rights and the rights of third-parties to obtain access to data for\\nappropriate purposes.\\n2012 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Regulations\\nIn 2012, the Obama Administration, through the Department, implemented regulatory amendments that\\ndramatically expanded FERPA. (The amended regulations were published in the Federal Register on December\\n2, 2011, but became effective on January 3, 2012.) The amendments greatly broadened the definition of who is\\ngiven access to personally identifiable information (PII) from student records on a non-consensual basis.\\nAACRAO believes that some of the 2012 regulatory changes are unnecessary and run counter to legislative\\nintent and plain language of the law. Additionally, most of the provisions that were adopted actually require\\nlegislative amendments to FERPA, and the Department lacks legal authority to implement them through\\nregulatory action. The association strongly urges that the following 2012 regulatory amendments to FERPA be\\nrescinded.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nThe Term \"Authorized Representative\" (\\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa799.3, 99.35)\\nAACRAO strongly supports the narrowing of the definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized representative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to individuals and\\nentities under the direct control of officials designated in the statute as entitled to non-consensual access to\\npersonally identifiable information from education records. While the term was not defined in previous versions\\nof the FERPA regulations, the common (and correct) understanding of this term was reflected in a January 30,\\n2003, memorandum issued by then-Deputy Secretary of Education, William D. Hansen. The memo explained\\nthat an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized representative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must be a party under the direct control of that authority, such as an\\nemployee or contractor, which the Hansen memo stated, was based on the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding of the\\nFERPA statute and Congressional statements as to its meaning. The 2012 regulatory changes inappropriately\\nexpanded this definition to anyone chosen by the designated officials.\\nPrior to the 2012 amendments, Section (b)(1) of FERPA conditioned receipt of any Department funds to any\\neducational agency or institution not having a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records\\n(or personally identifiable information (PII) other than directory information) of students without first obtaining\\nwritten consent, except under very specific circumstances. One exception to this requirement is for release of\\neducation records to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthorized representatives\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Secretary,\\nState educational authorities, or (for law enforcement purposes) the Attorney General. 20...  \n",

Headquartered in New Britain, CT, we employ over 1,000 individuals with\\nsignificant disabilities in meaningful and well-paying jobs throughout the country, many of whom are\\nemployed at military bases and prestigious government facilities as a direct result of the AbilityOne\\nprogram.\\nOur comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of\\nEducation (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the\\nintegrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment (34 CFR\\n\\xe0\\xb8\\xa2\\xe0\\xb8\\x87361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)) in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations\\nand guidance are stripping away the rights of people with disabilities by closing off meaningful and wellpaying jobs for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately\\ndisqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their\\nparticipation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program.\\nIn the absence of the AbilityOne program, many of the individuals we serve would not be employed or\\nwould be working in lower paying positions with minimal to no benefits. The unemployment rate for\\npeople with disabilities continues to be high, despite good intentions and various policies designed to\\nincrease employment. Eliminating and limiting job opportunities for any group of people, specifically for\\npeople with significant disabilities is unfair and disheartening.\\nTh e langu age in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA not only restricts access to quality\\ncompetitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities; it is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation,\\nthe department's longstanding practice and technical guidance. As an employer in a number of states,\\nsome of the vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies are discounting any AbilityOne job which is problematic\\nand can lead to unfilled positions.\\nWe respectfully request that the Do Ed immediately rescind the FAQ guidance (posted on Do Ed's website,\\nhttps://www2.ed .gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/wioa/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html )\\nrelated to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at\\ncommunity rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne\\nProgram, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in\\nRSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.l. 113-128). This is an Employment First approach which not only supports\\n\\n\\x0c200 Myrtle Street, New Britain, CT 06053\\n\\n860.229.7700\\n\\nindividual choice but wi ll lead to the employment for many individuals with significant disabilities in the\\nfuture.\\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit j ob\\ncreation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSandra M .

The AbilityOne Program\\n(authorized under the JWOD Act) mandates that 75% of the direct labor hours performed on a\\ncontract be accomplished by people with severe (significant) disabililties. Most of the service\\n(versus commodity) contracts are performed in government spaces and provide for substantial\\ninteraction with government employees, military personnel, and/or the general public. When the\\ndefinition of \"integrated\" was focused on the work environment these factors provided for\\nintegration. When WIOA changed the word from work \"environment\" to work \"unit\" the\\ninteraction with people other than co-workers was negated as a factor of consideration.\\nTo effe \\xc3\\x82\\xcb\\x87vely remove high-paying jobs with medical benefits from consideration for persons\\nrelyin u on their vocational rehabilitation counselors to help guide them in their job search is\\nludic\\n, but the position that the change in one word has created.\\n\\nGlobal Connections to Employment, Inc./ an affil iate of Lakevi ew Center.

       "16213  b'Division for Early Childhood\\nof the Council for Exceptional Children\\n2900 Crystal Drive, Suite 100\\nArlington, VA 22202-3557\\nPhone: 310-428-7209 | Fax: 855-678-1989\\nWebsite: dec-sped.org\\n\\nDocket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\\nDocument Number: 2017-13157\\nAugust 9, 2017\\nThe purpose of these comments is to voice strong support for the Individuals with Disabilities\\nEducation Act (IDEA) and the regulations that have been promulgated to support its\\nimplementation. IDEA and these regulations are critical to continuing the progress made over\\nthe last 30 years to ensure young children with or at risk for disabilities and their families\\nreceive the services they need to reach their full potential. The Division for Early Childhood\\n(DEC) of the Council for Exceptional Children is the largest membership organization focused\\nsolely on the development and education of young children (ages birth\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x938) with or at risk for\\ndisabilities and other special needs and their families. As such, DEC sees no need for repeal,\\nreplacement or modification of any IDEA regulations at this time and notes that changes to\\nregulations are better addressed in the context of a reauthorization. The current process is\\noutside of the usual order, and as a result, is likely to lack the in-depth stakeholder input and\\npublic discussion critical to the success of such an activity.\\nIDEA and its implementing regulations are designed to address both access to early intervention\\nand special education for children with disabilities, as well as the quality of those services. IDEA\\nParts A, B and C, outline the rights, responsibilities and infrastructures to ensure access to early\\nintervention and education for eligible children and their families. In Part D, IDEA provides for\\ninvestments in the quality of those services and infrastructures. Part D provides funding for\\nparent support and information centers and the demonstration and dissemination of evidencebased, effective practices.\\nThere is no doubt in the field of education and in the experiences of families, that IDEA is a\\nsuccess. Certainly, there are challenges in implementing such a broad and visionary policy and\\nfederal action can indeed assist in these efforts. But the answer to these challenges is not to\\nrevise or reduce IDEA regulations. Quite the contrary, these regulations support efforts to\\nimplement IDEA successfully. Fully funding IDEA federally would go a long way to addressing\\nthe challenges states and communities are facing.\\nIDEA has a federal infrastructure that implementation science tells us is necessary for the\\ninstallation of effective practices. This infrastructure includes guidance from OSEP in best\\n\\n\\x0cpractice, accountability, and monitoring. For the early childhood provisions of IDEA (Part C and\\nSection 619 of Part B), OSEP provides policy guidance as needed to state leaders to assist in\\ntheir efforts to help local early intervention programs and school districts implement effective\\npolicies, practices and accountability measures while also holding them accountable to indictors\\nof compliance and quality.\\nIDEA early childhood programs also serve as a key mechanism of supports and services for\\nyoung children with disabilities in community settings such as preschool, Head Start, Home\\nVisiting and child care/early learning. DEC appreciates the valuable policy guidance that has\\nbeen released in the last several years through collaboration across federal programs in the\\nDepartments of Education and Health and Human Services as well as other federal agencies as\\nneeded. This federal collaborative work has resulted in the release of a number of powerful\\npolicy statements from the respective Secretaries to assist local programs serving young\\nchildren in understanding best practice giving all young children opportunities to succeed and\\nbe ready for school. DEC requests that the Department continue these efforts. State and\\ncommunity leaders speak very highly of these policy statements and express how their use has\\nhelped further efforts for young children and families at the community level.

These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious,\\njob-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidance is\\nindiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit\\nagencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S.\\nAbilityOne Program.\\nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality\\ncompetitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the\\nregulation, the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longstanding practice and technical guidance. My state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vocational\\nrehabilitation (VR) agency is one of at least 19 states VR that have stopped referring and\\nplacing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program.\\n{Phoenix} is an NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and creates {300+} of jobs.\\nBecause referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased\\nemployment opportunities at my agency are going un-filled. Deserving individuals with\\nsignificant disabilities are denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our\\ncommunity.\\nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website,\\nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/wioa/competitive-integrated-employmentfaq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that\\nemployment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded\\nthrough the AbilityOne program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long\\nas it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128).\\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit\\njob creation.\\nSincerely,\\nAmy G. Patterson\\n\\n\\x0c'  \n",

       "10335  I am speaking as the director of non profit Day Training and Habilitation program that is licensed by the Department of Human Services in MN as well as meeting all of the certification requirements to maintain a 14c Special Wage Certificate We complied with all WIOA requirements during this first year and did not find the process helpful or meaningful In contrast we heard from many frustrated and upset Legal Representatives about the process There were nearly 200 Legal Reps for persons enrolled in our program who attended the required WIOA Career Counseling Information and Referral meetings and not a SINGLE one reported that it was beneficial or meaningful First of all these teams which include the client worker their Legal Representative and County Case Manager all point out that they have all talked about discussed explored the options for community based employment over the many many years they have been receiving services This meeting requirement doesn t bring up anything NEW to the team as this discussion has always been a requirement outlined in our licensing standards so it s a duplicative process The career counseling meetings required legal reps to often take time out of their own work day travel a significant distance to watch a 10 minute power point on the benefits of employment in a competitive and integrated setting Early on there were some teams that were indeed intrigued and indicated that YES they are interested What they subsequently learned was that the presentation was very misleading in how it was presented as these folks thought the entity offering the counseling were also there to HELP them in securing and sustaining the competitive employment Well they learned quickly that wasn t the case What it required was yet another special team meeting where the representative from the counseling session would attend and report that the person said YES and then they essentially wash their hands of things The person their Legal Rep and County Case Manager are in the same situation as they ve been for years if competitive integrated employment was viable and feasible for the person then it has been addressed for years and years and the required WIOA Counseling session does nothing to provide additional resources or supports These team members then get angry and frustrated and feel mislead by the process that wasted their time and gave them false hopes Now they are learning that they need to repeat the entire process this year and in subsequent years I would strongly recommend that at the very least this requirement be a one and done meeting that is documented Better yet incorporate the requirement into the ANNUAL team meetings that we must have as a condition of licensure within our state If it must be a separate counseling session that consists of nothing more than watching a misleading power point presentation then at least develop an option for Legal Representatives to complete the requirement on line or via fax or mail rather than taking time away from work with unnecessary travel time As a 14C Special Wage Certificate holder we are also required to provide information on the special wages offered for work based upon a persons productivity when a person enrolls in the program This is discussed by the team on an annual basis These wages are based upon prevailing wages for an experienced worker in our community and are evaluated on an annual basis and also submitted to the Department of Labor for review and renewal of the certificate Not everyone is able to work at the same pace or productivity level as an experience worker doing a similar job in the community making minimum wage or higher The 14c Special Wage certificate allows individuals who can t maintain that level of productivity to engage in meaningful paid work and to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment even if that means they worked at 40 of what the worker making minimum wage in the community makes Yes they are paid less but they are paid a FAIR wage based upon what they are physically or cognitively capable of doing in relation to the prevailing wage analysis the DOL requires We believe strongly that it s important to retain this option for the clients who have more significant challenges as it affords them the opportunity to engage in paid work at whatever level pace productivity level they are capable of which can vary hour by hour and day to day A community based employer is not going to be tolerant of that Let s redirect all of the time energy money that is being spent on imposing the required annual Career Counseling 2x a year if you are just starting to work under the special wage certificate and build up job placement and ongoing supports for those folks who REALLY WANT the option to work competitively in the community who chose this option and who would benefit from the ongoing supports   \n",

       "11354  I raised two daughters who are dyslexic but all through school we had no idea what the problem was and I am a public school educator It wasn t until my girls were grown and I had volunteered as a tutor for illiterate adults that I discovered dyslexia and then I realized that is what my girls had been dealing with all through school The most unfortunate part is that the younger daughter is adopted She came to us as a foster child and we ended up adopting her State money deferred at her adoption was available to us for assistance as needed for things such as learning disabilities etc If we had only known what she was dealing with we could have hired specialized tutors or purchased an Orton Gillingham reading and spelling system for home tutoring which likely could have helped her stay on track had we started early enough I know schools do not like to label kids but when it comes to dyslexia it is very important that people know what their children are dealing with in order to get the appropriate interventions going   \n",

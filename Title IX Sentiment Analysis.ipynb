       "      <td>The Honorable Betsy DeVos Secretary US Department of Education Westchester Independent Living Center WILC is a not for profit community based resource advocacy and training center dedicated to improving the quality of life for people with disabilities WILC has been providing services since 1981 to people of all ages with all types of disabilities in Westchester County and the Lower Hudson Valley Region WILC works within the community to provide education disability awareness and advocacy for the removal of barriers Federal regulations and non regulatory guidance help states and school districts fully implement the laws such as the IDEA ESSA and WIOA which are critical to ensuring students with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other kid Stakeholders rely on these authorities to assist them in understanding and complying with the statutes As such none should be modified or rescinded by the Administration As a citizen I firmly stand behind the laws listed below and their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to ensuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families I urge you not to modify or rescind any Civil Rights Act of 1964 Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for America s children including students with disabilities I write to urge you not to repeal replace or modify any of the regulations or guidance that ensure they are implemented appropriately My nephew Albert was born with a hearing loss and wasn t diagnosed until the age of 5 When he was to attend high school a large school of 3 000 students my family was concerned that he would not get the proper accommodations at such a large school We were represented by an education lawyer and the school district agreed to provide funding for my nephew nephew to attend a high school in Westchester County New York as the school had a special program for the deaf and hard of hearing Albert thrived in this environment academically and had many good friends with like disabilities When it came to College my nephew attended Rochester Institute of Technology and was admitted into the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at RIT My nephew maintained a respectable B grade point average At RIT Albert met his fiancee I couldn t imagine what my nephew s life would be like if he didn t receive the academic accommodations that were so critical to him and life changing There are many children whose future depends on their getting the proper accommodations in their school district and as for my nephew attending a different school when accommodations aren t available at their local school Our country should give every student with a disability the chance to compete on a level playing field working with administration and teachers that are familiar with the needs of students with particular disabilities Please support laws that help students to achieve and thrive academically and socially and eventually professionally Respectfully submitted Joseph L Guagliano Westchester Independent Living Center 845 228 7457 Ext 1105</td>\n",

       "12082  Together with my colleagues in the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers I strongly urge that the following 2012 regulatory amendments to FERPA be rescinded 2012 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA Regulations In 2012 the Obama Administration through the Department of Education implemented regulatory amendments that dramatically expanded FERPA The amendments greatly broadened the definition of who is given access to personally identifiable information PII from student records on a nonconsensual basis AACRAO strongly urges that the following 2012 regulatory amendments to FERPA be rescinded We believe that the definition Authorized Representative should be restored to its previous definition of individuals and entities under direct control of officials as designated in the original statute The 2012 regulations also overreached on the definition of Implied Authority to audit programs and have created much confusion and lacks legal precedent We urge the Task Force to close this loophole for non consensual disclosure of education records The 2012 regulations vastly widened the definition of Education Programs to include programs not administered by educational authorities We believe that the definition should revert back to the original programs administered by an educational agency or institution The 2012 regulations expanded the meaning of non consensual disclosure of personal information from education records to organization conducting for or on behalf of educational agencies or institutions We strongly urge the restoration of the limitation on the purposes for which the research exception may be invoked and to statutorily prohibit re disclosure of personally identifiable information by organizations accessing education records under this exception We believe that the definition Authorized Representative should be restored to its previous definition of individuals and entities under direct control of officials as designated in the original statute The 2012 regulations also overreached on the definition of Implied Authority to audit programs and have created much confusion and lacks legal precedent We urge the Task Force to close this loophole for non consensual disclosure of education records The 2012 regulations vastly widened the definition of Education Programs to include programs not administered by educational authorities We believe that the definition should revert back to the original programs administered by an educational agency or institution The 2012 regulations expanded the meaning of non consensual disclosure of personal information from education records to organization conducting for or on behalf of educational agencies or institutions We strongly urge the restoration of the limitation on the purposes for which the research exception may be invoked and to statutorily prohibit re disclosure of personally identifiable information by organizations accessing education records under this exception On August 24 2016 the Department issued a Dear Colleague Letter outlining its final guidance on the obligations of institutional school officials under FERPA 20 U S C 1232g and the regulations in 34 C F R Part 99 to protect students education records from disclosure without consent and provides guidance more specifically on the disclosure of student medical records The guidance reviewed and clarified the agency s views regarding the protections applicable to student medical records specifically in cases where litigation occurs between the institution and the student The letter advised colleges to handle the privacy of student medical records under FERPA similarly to the way health care providers and hospitals are required to treat such records We urge the task force to recommend that the department modify its guidance to defer to FERPA when student medical records are involved as previous joint guidance advises On January 19 2017 the outgoing Obama administration issued a final rule that amended FERPA to change the name of the office designated enforcement functions by the Secretary from the Family Policy Compliance Office FPCO to the Office of the Chief Privacy Officer as part of an expansion of student privacy operations at the Department We urge the task force to recommend that the department rescind this regulatory change and restore FPCO and its Director as the office designated to administer FERPA in all aspects   \n",

0074 Evaluation of Existing Regulations Dear Ms Malawer I am a parent from Port Washington NY I am writing in response to the U S Department of Education s ED request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration My work role as a parent directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation guidance technical assistance and or other administrative activity must be whether the regulation guidance advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students Therefore COPAA believes ED s narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nation s education laws students Therefore it is on behalf of children with disabilities in my school Paul D Schreiber Port Washington NY and their families that I make the following recommendations 1 Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws I strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Education Amendments Act of 1972 particularly Title IX The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Particularly Section 504 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA The Higher Education Act HEA The Americans with Disabilities Act ADA The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act WIOA The Carl D Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act PERKINS Freedom of Information Act FOIA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA As this relates to IDEA in particular 20 U S C Sec 1232 states The Secretary may not implement or publish in final form any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20 1983 particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education least restrictive environment related services timelines attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings or qualifications of personnel except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance 2 Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws 3 Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters 4 Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters DCL that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parent s right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA The letters to rescind are Parent s right to include invite participants to IEP meetings o Letter to Anonymous 2003 o Letter to Byrd 2003 Rationale These letters must be rescinded IDEA 20 U S C 1414 d 1 B vi and the regulations 30 C F R 300 321 a 6 and c allows parents and school district at their discretion to include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent s right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings Parent s and expert s right to observe the child in the classroom Letter to Mamas 2004 Rationale This letter must be rescinded As stated above Congress has repeatedly found that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home 601 C 5 To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom To fully participate as members of the IEP team they should have the right to observe the child s education in progress a proposed placement whether accommodations and services are being provided and other matters Independent Education Evaluations IEE The right of the family to include recommendations to the IEP team from the evaluator Letter to LaDolce 2007 Rationale This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C F R 300 503 c requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained

Educational Amendments of 1972 be updated to include the below provisions that clearly connect sexual violence to sex discrimination forward trauma informed and wellness centered protocols and practices and build transparent and accessible accountability structures separate from the criminal justice system CALCASA is the technical assistance and training provider for 84 rape crisis centers in California as well as the founding member of Raliance a long time service provider and collaborator with campus programs throughout the United States and a California and national voice for survivors of sexual assault Just a few short years ago Title IX was seriously under utilized and under enforced Survivors of sexual assault on and around campus were silenced ignored and chastised Sexual violence was an accepted social norm on many campuses Students and advocates organized to shine a light on this unacceptable state and many survivors came forward with similar stories of schools ignoring sexual harassment and sexual violence or shared experiences of schools having largely inappropriate and useless processes for handling grievances As a nation we cannot go back to these dark ages of ignoring sexual harassment on campus and failing to create safe and healthy school systems from Kindergarten to graduate school Now is the time to preserve valuable gains in how sexual harassment is taken seriously in schools throughout the nation CALCASA recommends that the following features of guidance for Title IX include Definitions Sexual violence is a form of sexual harassment and is the prevue of Title IX enforcement and regulation through the Office of Civil Rights Sexual violence refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent due to the victim s use of drugs or alcohol Sexual violence can include rape sexual assault sexual battery and sexual coercion Notice Notice of nondiscrimination must be published 34 CFR 106 8 b and 106 9 This should be further strengthened with requirements to put notice on websites and in easily accessible common areas Title IX E ee Schools must designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX Title IX implementing regulation 34 CFR 106 8 a Notice of who this person is should be published in a way that is accessible and easily available Training Schools need to insure that employees are properly trained regarding reporting and responding to harassment Training shall include practical information about how to identify and report sexual harassment and violence This training should be provided to all employees likely to witness or receive reports of sexual harassment and violence including but not limited to teachers school law enforcement school administrators school counselors general counsels health personnel and resident advisors Fact finders and decision makers in the hearing process need adequate training including training on applicable confidentiality and privileged communications requirements Off Campus Considerations Off campus impacts shall be considered in evaluating a hostile environment on campus Complaint procedures should be followed regardless of where the conduct occurred Office of Civil Rights Oversight OCR will continue to review all aspects of the school s compliance with Title IX including procedures notice and training Confidentiality and Privilege Confidentiality requests and confidentiality and privileged communications laws in the state should be respected and safeguarded to the extent possible Intersections with Criminal Investigations Criminal investigation into allegations of sexual violence does not relieve the school of its duty under Title IX to resolve complaints promptly and equitably And police investigations or reports are not determinative of whether sexual harassment violates Title IX Schools should notify complainant of right to file a criminal complaint and not dissuade a victim from doing so at any time Schools should not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin their own Title IX investigation Schools must if needed take immediate steps to protect the student in the educational setting and not wait to see if alleged perpetrator is found guilty of a crime Further MOUs with law enforcement agencies need to include clear policies on when a school will refer a matter to local law enforcement Evidence Standard for Hearings Proceedings A

Order EO 13777 Federal agencies are directed to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to agency heads to repeal replace or modify relevant regulations Among other activities the Task Force must seek input from key stakeholders on regulations that meet certain criteria In the context of EO 13777 regulation means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effort designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency excluding specific regulations The Virginia Department of the Blind and Vision Impaired DBVI has reviewed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended the United States Department of Education DOE regulations found at 34 CFR Part 361 and the DOE Rehabilitation Services Administration RSA guidance and policy statements to identify regulatory provisions that are unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome to State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs in the administration of VR Services to individuals with disabilities Included in these comments are issues that impact DBVI s ability to provide efficient and effective services to potentially eligible and eligible individuals including students and youth who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind 1 Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 2017 ISSUE 1 Recordkeeping regarding the provision of Pre ETS services and the accounting for use of those funds causes Administrative Burden RSA has issued guidance and provided training regarding states responsibilities for accounting of Pre ETS expenditures that is burdensome and places unrealistic expectations for VR agencies as they attempt to document accounting of the 15 set aside funds and the provision of Pre ETS The provision of Pre ETS ensures that students with disabilities are provided with more finely tuned services that ultimately lead to better competitive integrated employment options However new data collection requirements and development of new reporting systems specific to Pre ETS causes undue administrative burden on agencies and have the unintended consequence of taking valuable time from VR Counselors and other staff that could be spent on identifying progressive ways to provide services to students Recommendation Solution That RSA and State VR agencies collaborate to establish reasonable and accomplishable documentation standards for Pre ETS 15 reserved funds and case records that do not place unnecessary administrative burden on VR agencies ISSUE 2 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 i A 2 and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of student with a disability and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of State cause unintended consequences DBVI is one of two designated state units DSU providing vocational rehabilitation services to people with disabilities in Virginia DBVI serves individuals who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind including 2 Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 2017 students and youth 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 A 2 and 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 B 2 contain defining language of student with a disability that provides for states to elect to use lower minimum age or higher maximum age for the provision of Pre ETS as long as the minimum or maximum ages are in compliance with WIOA and IDEA respectively Guidance from RSA has been that States with two DSUs like Virginia must agree on the age at which Pre ETS must be available to students The regulatory justification for RSA s guidance is found at 34 CFR 361 5 c 48 where state is defined as any of the 50 states unfortunately this definition does not account for states in which there are more than one DSU There are significant and serious unintended consequences of RSA s interpretation especially for DSUs like DBVI who is providing Pre ETS for students who are blind vision impaired and deafblind where more than 80 of total number of eligible individuals served in the VR program are older than the defined age of students with disabilities Because the population of school aged students 14 to 21 served by DBVI is much smaller than the number of students served by the general VR agency DBVI has the capacity to serve more students at an earlier age In fact DBVI could serve approximately 75 more students including middle school students if allowed to determine the minimum and maximum age at which Pre ETS could potentially begin independent of the general VR agency DBVI has found over time that providing services such as orientation and mobility instruction and assistive technology as soon as possible raises expectations for students academic accomplishments and leads to greater opportunities for employment The requirement to establish minimum and maximum ages in conjunction with the general agency causes 3 Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 ...</td>\n",

the United States Congress to protect the rights of people with disabilities and their families through legal support advocacy referral and education P As and CAPs are in all 50 states the District of Columbia Puerto Rico and the U S Territories American Samoa Guam Northern Mariana Islands and the US Virgin Islands and there is a P A and CAP affiliated with the Native American Consortium which includes the Hopi Navajo and San Juan Southern Piute Nations in the Four Corners region of the Southwest Collectively the 57 P A and CAP agencies are the largest provider of legally based advocacy services to people with disabilities in the United States Two critical areas of focus for the P A CAP agencies are education and vocational rehabilitation In 2016 the P As worked on nearly 14 000 individual cases related to enforcing the civil rights of students with disabilities and the CAP agencies worked on nearly 18 000 cases including information and referral related to vocational rehabilitation Both of these are under the jurisdiction of the U S Department of 820 FIRST STREET NE SUITE 740 WASHINGTON DC 20002 4243 TEL 202 408 9514 FAX 202 408 9520 TTY 202 408 9521 WEBSITE WWW NDRN ORG E MAIL INFO ORG Education As such the P As enforcement work is inextricably linked to U S Department of Education NDRN views the work of the U S Department of Education as critical and the effort to repeal replace or modify existing regulations and guidance as irresponsible Our concerns are detailed below For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for America s children including students with disabilities Some of these laws were enacted in response to widespread discrimination which was confronted by strong citizen activism and litigation brought by individuals facing discrimination The following laws we believe are the most significant to correcting discrimination and sustaining equity in our education system NDRN firmly stands behind these laws their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to assuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families including Civil Rights Act of 1964 Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 NDRN rejects the notion that the process the Department is engaging in in response to Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda will benefit the 50 4 million K 12 students and will aid the Department in fulfilling its stated mission to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access The process of promulgating regulations is codified in the Public Law P L 404 49 the Administrative Procedures Act APA and is a bedrock of administrative law The stated purpose of P L 404 70 is to improve the administration of justice by prescribing fair administrative procedure In describing the APA more than forty years ago Senator McCarran noted that the APA was a bill of rights for the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated by federal government agencies 2 The regulations listed for possible repeal replace or modify by the U S Department of Education have already gone through the open transparent and prescribed procedure as mandated by the APA For all regulations the rulemaking process begins after Congress passes a bill and the President signs it into law Before the draft rule is published by the federal agency it is reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget OMB It is important to note that draft regulations are written by dedicated career staff who are independent of political affiliation The public then has 30 to 90 days to provide feedback Agencies must consider all comments document responses...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Example of WIOA Regulations Impact on Employment NewView Oklahoma NVO performs mail services at the Navy Mail Center in Norfolk Virginia The main mail center employs five general clerks and a supervisor General clerks are paid the SCA wage and determination rate and also receive health and welfare rate that includes a full benefit package These contract employees work side by side with the military and government civilian employees to distribute and process over 750 000 pieces of mail per month In November of 2016 working with the Department for the Blind and Visually Impaired for the State of Virginia DBVI NVO selected a candidate for the position of General Clerk II for the Norfolk mail center As a military mail center Norfolk requires a Secret Clearance That November the candidate submitted her documents for the clearance process An interim Secret Clearance was granted 125 days after submission and NVO extended an official offer to the candidate NVO began the onboarding process The candidate informed NVO Service Contract Program Manager that they would be unable to accept the position When asked why the candidate was turning down a position that they had waited over four months to start the candidate stated that DBVI was refusing to pay for transportation to and from work because the contract the position was on an AbilityOne contract DBVI also explained that they would not offer rehab services or any support whatsoever if they accepted the position DBVI was offering the candidate a commercial position that paid 4 00 less an hour with no benefits The candidate was planning to accept the commercial position because they could not afford the cost of transportation before receiving their first paycheck NVO offered to pay for transportation until the candidate received their first paycheck The candidate accepted the position and began working NVO reached out to the DBVI for an explanation DBVI explained that in the 125 days that the candidate had been waiting to receive her clearance changes in policy were made at DBVI that all AbilityOne contracts were sheltered work environments and did not meet WIOA s requirement for integrated workplaces Although DBVI had visited the mail center and had observed the integrated environment services would be refused because it was an AbilityOne contract If the candidate had accepted the commercial position it would have successfully closed the case The candidate accepting a position on an AbilityOne contract did not successfully close the case according to DBVI because it didn t fit the definition of an integrated workplace NVO reiterated to DBVI that if the candidate would have accepted the commercial position that DBVI was offering the candidate would have a lost 17 000 annually in salary and benefits</td>\n",

       "      <td>I sit and look at our family photo taken two days before my son returned to college just after Thanksgiving What happened next was a life changing event for all of us My goal is to show you the lack of due process how biased unfair and impartial the college system is as well as how my son was not allowed to be heard once he was wrongly accused of breaking the sexual misconduct policy on his college campus At approximately 1 00am Monday morning 11 28 there was a knock on my son s college door He was handed a No Contact order with a particular student He was not told why where when or what this was about The next day my son was called into the Associate Dean of Student s Senior Deputy Title IX Director s Dean Deputy office and told there was a sexual misconduct against him on the eve of 11 21 in his townhouse No other information was offered at this time He was told he could make a statement at a later date My son was upset angry and did not understand what was going on He was allowed to go to class but was pulled out of class again to talk with the Dean Deputy He was now told he had been suspended The Dean Deputy escorted him to meet up with two Residential Directors all three men then escorted my son to his townhouse and off campus While being escorted off campus signs were being hung on all the buildings warning there was a sexual assault Everyone on campus was emailed and notified at this time This information was released to the newspapers and media You could read the headlines or watch it on the news Sexual assault on XXX College campus Imagine how you would feel your friends watching you be escorted away like a criminal You don t even know why this is happening you only know they did not want to hear your side of the story The next day my husband and son were allowed to return to the campus to get some more things They spoke with the Title IX director about the unfair treatment of our son The Title IX director stated that there was a lot of pressure from the Federal Government and that this is just how things work Four days later Thursday 12 1 16 it was explained to my son that there was inappropriate touching with provided examples by the Dean Deputy he also told my son he did not get confirmative consent The Dean Deputy states he had not read the complaint but had a general idea of the issue and he will not provide any information from the statement He explains they will take statements from my son the complainant and witnesses putting together a case book so that if my son is then charged he would be notified of the charges and given an outcome of investigation My son could then review those materials and write an impact statement The Dean Deputy then confirmed with my son that when they had met yesterday he had informed my son he was being emph charged with sexual misconduct He states he provided this information so my son now could decide what to do We asked the Dean Deputy if we were in the Formal process His response was yes there is a formal process in place we are involved in an investigation at this time The Dean Deputy told us he is not investigating and in no way shape or form does he have anything to do with the conclusion The Dean Deputy is confusing telling my son he is charged with sexual misconduct and indicating we are in a formal process and an investigation It sounds like the Dean Deputy has already determined my son is charged and he is being treated as guilty How can we not feel that the college is biased against our son That afternoon 12 1 at 3 37 pm my son received an email we now need to provide a statement and a list of witnesses by Monday 12 5 Is four days reasonable to provide a statement on a sexual misconduct charge Especially knowing any statement made emph could be used against my son in a criminal case We were also reminded in an email by the college whether you choose to submit a statement or decline to college policy misconduct process will proceed Typically if you do not participate in the college process silence results in a responsible finding and you are often expelled What kind of choice is this We are allowed a lawyer but they can only serve in an advisory role and may not directly represent policy my son How can we find someone to help us quickly and respond within a four day deadline with two of the days being a weekend We were fortunate and did find a lawyer My son submitted a statement Monday 12 5 Now we wait Thursday 12 15 we receive the Notice of Outcome The charge is rape and fondling How did we go from inappropriate touching to this My son was never unclothed there was no intercourse oral sex drugs or alcohol Texts submitted by my son show she was ambivalent and was putting pressure on herself She stated Like you know that I just got out of a relationship so I m really weird with the pace of stuff for us and I m not ready for a lot of stuff and I m a pain in the ass and lk I told you not to expect anything but I feel like you do My son s reply to thi...</td>\n",

Evaluation of Existing Regulations Dear Ms Malawer I am a parent from Port Washington NY I am writing in response to the U S Department of Education s ED request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration My work role as a parent directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation guidance technical assistance and or other administrative activity must be whether the regulation guidance advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students Therefore COPAA believes ED s narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly

       "32  ED 2017 OS 0074 The California Coalition Against Sexual Assault CALCASA formally requests that binding regulations on the enforcement and interpretation of Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 be updated to include the below provisions that clearly connect sexual violence to sex discrimination forward trauma informed and wellness centered protocols and practices and build transparent and accessible accountability structures separate from the criminal justice system CALCASA is the technical assistance and training provider for 84 rape crisis centers in California as well as the founding member of Raliance a long time service provider and collaborator with campus programs throughout the United States and a California and national voice for survivors of sexual assault Just a few short years ago Title IX was seriously under utilized and under enforced Survivors of sexual assault on and around campus were silenced ignored and chastised Sexual violence was an accepted social norm on many campuses Students and advocates organized to shine a light on this unacceptable state and many survivors came forward with similar stories of schools ignoring sexual harassment and sexual violence or shared experiences of schools having largely inappropriate and useless processes for handling grievances As a nation we cannot go back to these dark ages of ignoring sexual harassment on campus and failing to create safe and healthy school systems from Kindergarten to graduate school Now is the time to preserve valuable gains in how sexual harassment is taken seriously in schools throughout the nation CALCASA recommends that the following features of guidance for Title IX include Definitions Sexual violence is a form of sexual harassment and is the prevue of Title IX enforcement and regulation through the Office of Civil Rights Sexual violence refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent due to the victim s use of drugs or alcohol Sexual violence can include rape sexual assault sexual battery and sexual coercion Notice Notice of nondiscrimination must be published 34 CFR 106 8 b and 106 9 This should be further strengthened with requirements to put notice on websites and in easily accessible common areas Title IX E ee Schools must designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX Title IX implementing regulation 34 CFR 106 8 a Notice of who this person is should be published in a way that is accessible and easily available Training Schools need to insure that employees are properly trained regarding reporting and responding to harassment Training shall include practical information about how to identify and report sexual harassment and violence This training should be provided to all employees likely to witness or receive reports of sexual harassment and violence including but not limited to teachers school law enforcement school administrators school counselors general counsels health personnel and resident advisors Fact finders and decision makers in the hearing process need adequate training including training on applicable confidentiality and privileged communications requirements Off Campus Considerations Off campus impacts shall be considered in evaluating a hostile environment on campus Complaint procedures should be followed regardless of where the conduct occurred Office of Civil Rights Oversight OCR will continue to review all aspects of the school s compliance with Title IX including procedures notice and training Confidentiality and Privilege Confidentiality requests and confidentiality and privileged communications laws in the state should be respected and safeguarded to the extent possible Intersections with Criminal Investigations Criminal investigation into allegations of sexual violence does not relieve the school of its duty under Title IX to resolve complaints promptly and equitably And police investigations or reports are not determinative of whether sexual harassment violates Title IX Schools should notify complainant of right to file a criminal complaint and not dissuade a victim from doing so at any time Schools should not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin their own Title IX investigation Schools must if needed take immediate steps to protect the student in the educational setting and not wait to see if alleged perpetrator is found guilty of a crime Further MOUs with law enforcement agencies need to include clear policies on when a school will refer a matter to local law enforcement Evidence Standard for Hearings Proceedings A preponderance of the evidence

       "65  Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 2017 Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired Regulatory Reform Comments September 19 2017 Pursuit to Presidential Executive Order EO 13777 Federal agencies are directed to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to agency heads to repeal replace or modify relevant regulations Among other activities the Task Force must seek input from key stakeholders on regulations that meet certain criteria In the context of EO 13777 regulation means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effort designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency excluding specific regulations The Virginia Department of the Blind and Vision Impaired DBVI has reviewed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended the United States Department of Education DOE regulations found at 34 CFR Part 361 and the DOE Rehabilitation Services Administration RSA guidance and policy statements to identify regulatory provisions that are unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome to State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs in the administration of VR Services to individuals with disabilities Included in these comments are issues that impact DBVI s ability to provide efficient and effective services to potentially eligible and eligible individuals including students and youth who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind 1 Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 2017 ISSUE 1 Recordkeeping regarding the provision of Pre ETS services and the accounting for use of those funds causes Administrative Burden RSA has issued guidance and provided training regarding states responsibilities for accounting of Pre ETS expenditures that is burdensome and places unrealistic expectations for VR agencies as they attempt to document accounting of the 15 set aside funds and the provision of Pre ETS The provision of Pre ETS ensures that students with disabilities are provided with more finely tuned services that ultimately lead to better competitive integrated employment options However new data collection requirements and development of new reporting systems specific to Pre ETS causes undue administrative burden on agencies and have the unintended consequence of taking valuable time from VR Counselors and other staff that could be spent on identifying progressive ways to provide services to students Recommendation Solution That RSA and State VR agencies collaborate to establish reasonable and accomplishable documentation standards for Pre ETS 15 reserved funds and case records that do not place unnecessary administrative burden on VR agencies ISSUE 2 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 i A 2 and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of student with a disability and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of State cause unintended consequences DBVI is one of two designated state units DSU providing vocational rehabilitation services to people with disabilities in Virginia DBVI serves individuals who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind including 2 Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 2017 students and youth 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 A 2 and 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 B 2 contain defining language of student with a disability that provides for states to elect to use lower minimum age or higher maximum age for the provision of Pre ETS as long as the minimum or maximum ages are in compliance with WIOA and IDEA respectively Guidance from RSA has been that States with two DSUs like Virginia must agree on the age at which Pre ETS must be available to students The regulatory justification for RSA s guidance is found at 34 CFR 361 5 c 48 where state is defined as any of the 50 states unfortunately this definition does not account for states in which there are more than one DSU There are significant and serious unintended consequences of RSA s interpretation especially for DSUs like DBVI who is providing Pre ETS for students who are blind vision impaired and deafblind where more than 80 of total number of eligible individuals served in the VR program are older than the defined age of students with disabilities Because the population of school aged students 14 to 21 served by DBVI is much smaller than the number of students served by the general VR agency DBVI has the capacity to serve more students at an earlier age In fact DBVI could serve approximately 75 more students including middle school students if allowed to determine the minimum and maximum age at which Pre ETS could potentially begin independent of the general VR agency DBVI has found over time that providing services such as orientation and mobility instruction and assistive technology as soon as possible raises expectations for students academic accomplishments and leads to greater opportunities for employment The requirement to establish minimum and maximum ages in conjunction with the general agency causes 3 Policy Planning Evaluation Unit SDP 9 19 ...   \n",

Education As such the P As enforcement work is inextricably linked to U S Department of Education NDRN views the work of the U S Department of Education as critical and the effort to repeal replace or modify existing regulations and guidance as irresponsible Our concerns are detailed below For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for America s children including students with disabilities Some of these laws were enacted in response to widespread discrimination which was confronted by strong citizen activism and litigation brought by individuals facing discrimination The following laws we believe are the most significant to correcting discrimination and sustaining equity in our education system NDRN firmly stands behind these laws their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to assuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families including Civil Rights Act of 1964 Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and

Regulatory Reform Agenda will benefit the 50 4 million K 12 students and will aid the Department in fulfilling its stated mission to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access The process of promulgating regulations is codified in the Public Law P L 404 49 the Administrative Procedures Act APA and

listed for possible repeal replace or modify by the U S Department of Education have already gone through the open transparent and prescribed procedure as mandated by the APA For all regulations the rulemaking process begins after Congress passes a bill and the President signs it into law Before the draft rule is published by the federal agency it is reviewed by the Office of Management and

             Example of WIOA Regulations Impact on Employment NewView Oklahoma NVO performs mail services at the Navy Mail Center in Norfolk Virginia The main mail center employs five general clerks and a supervisor General clerks are paid the SCA wage and determination rate and also receive health and welfare rate that includes a full benefit package These contract employees work side by side with the military and government civilian employees to distribute and process over 750 000 pieces of mail per month In November of 2016 working with the Department for the Blind and Visually Impaired for the State of Virginia DBVI NVO selected a candidate for the position of General Clerk II for the Norfolk mail center As a military mail center Norfolk requires a Secret Clearance That November the candidate submitted her documents for the clearance process An interim Secret Clearance was granted 125 days after submission and NVO extended an official offer to the candidate NVO began the onboarding process The candidate informed NVO Service Contract Program Manager that they would be unable to accept the position When asked why the candidate was turning down a position that they had waited over four months to start the candidate stated that DBVI was refusing to pay for transportation to and from work because the contract the position was on an AbilityOne contract DBVI also explained that they would not offer rehab services or any support whatsoever if they accepted the position DBVI was offering the candidate a commercial position that paid 4 00 less an hour with no benefits The candidate was planning to accept the commercial position because they could not afford the cost of transportation before receiving their first paycheck NVO offered to pay for transportation until the candidate received their first paycheck The candidate accepted the position and began working NVO reached out to the DBVI for an explanation DBVI explained that in the 125 days that the candidate had been waiting to receive her clearance changes in policy were made at DBVI that all AbilityOne contracts were sheltered work environments and did not meet WIOA s requirement for integrated workplaces Although DBVI had visited the mail center and had observed the integrated environment services would be refused because it was an AbilityOne contract If the candidate had accepted the commercial position it would have successfully closed the case The candidate accepting a position on an AbilityOne contract did not successfully close the case according to DBVI because it didn t fit the definition of an integrated workplace NVO reiterated to DBVI that if the candidate would have accepted the commercial position that DBVI was offering the candidate would have a lost 17 000 annually in salary and benefits   \n",
       "77  I sit and look at our family photo taken two days before my son returned to college just after Thanksgiving What happened next was a life changing event for all of us My goal is to show you the lack of due process how biased unfair and impartial the college system is as well as how my son was not allowed to be heard once he was wrongly accused of breaking the sexual misconduct policy on his college campus At approximately 1 00am Monday morning 11 28 there was a knock on my son s college door He was handed a No Contact order with a particular student He was not told why where when or what this was about The next day my son was called into the Associate Dean of Student s Senior Deputy Title IX Director s Dean Deputy office and told there was a sexual misconduct against him on the eve of 11 21 in his townhouse No other information was offered at this time He was told he could make a statement at a later date My son was upset angry and did not understand what was going on He was allowed to go to class but was pulled out of class again to talk with the Dean Deputy He was now told he had been suspended The Dean Deputy escorted him to meet up with two Residential Directors all three men then escorted my son to his townhouse and off campus While being escorted off campus signs were being hung on all the buildings warning there was a sexual assault Everyone on campus was emailed and notified at this time This information was released to the newspapers and media You could read the headlines or watch it on the news Sexual assault on XXX College campus Imagine how you would feel your friends watching you be escorted away like a criminal You don t even know why this is happening you only know they did not want to hear your side of the story The next day my husband and son were allowed to return to the campus to get some more things They spoke with the Title IX director about the unfair treatment of our son The Title IX director stated that there was a lot of pressure from the Federal Government and that this is just how things work Four days later Thursday 12 1 16 it was explained to my son that there was inappropriate touching with provided examples by the Dean Deputy he also told my son he did not get confirmative consent The Dean Deputy states he had not read the complaint but had a general idea of the issue and he will not provide any information from the statement He explains they will take statements from my son the complainant and witnesses putting together a case book so that if my son is then charged he would be notified of the charges and given an outcome of investigation My son could then review those materials and write an impact statement The Dean Deputy then confirmed with my son that when they had met yesterday he had informed my son he was being emph charged with sexual misconduct He states he provided this information so my son now could decide what to do We asked the Dean Deputy if we were in the Formal process His response was yes there is a formal process in place we are involved in an investigation at this time The Dean Deputy told us he is not investigating and in no way shape or form does he have anything to do with the conclusion The Dean Deputy is confusing telling my son he is charged with sexual misconduct and indicating we are in a formal process and an investigation It sounds like the Dean Deputy has already determined my son is charged and he is being treated as guilty How can we not feel that the college is biased against our son That afternoon 12 1 at 3 37 pm my son received an email we now need to provide a statement and a list of witnesses by Monday 12 5 Is four days reasonable to provide a statement on a sexual misconduct charge Especially knowing any statement made emph could be used against my son in a criminal case We were also reminded in an email by the college whether you choose to submit a statement or decline to college policy misconduct process will proceed Typically if you do not participate in the college process silence results in a responsible finding and you are often expelled What kind of choice is this We are allowed a lawyer but they can only serve in an advisory role and may not directly represent policy my son How can we find someone to help us quickly and respond within a four day deadline with two of the days being a weekend We were fortunate and did find a lawyer My son submitted a statement Monday 12 5 Now we wait Thursday 12 15 we receive the Notice of Outcome The charge is rape and fondling How did we go from inappropriate touching to this My son was never unclothed there was no intercourse oral sex drugs or alcohol Texts submitted by my son show she was ambivalent and was putting pressure on herself She stated Like you know that I just got out of a relationship so I m really weird with the pace of stuff for us and I m not ready for a lot of stuff and I m a pain in the ass and lk I told you not to expect anything but I feel like you do My son s reply to thi...   \n",

2017 Hilary Malawer Assistant General Counsel Office of the General Counsel U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Room 6E231 Washington DC 20202 Dear Ms Malawer As part of the U S Department of Education s evaluation of existing regulations please consider modifying your regulation defining competitive integrated employment to more accurately reflect congressional intent and current law Easterseals Western and Central Pennsylvania partners with our state s vocational rehabilitation agency to help individuals with disabilities access the employment supports and services they need to find meaningful employment in their communities Employment of individuals with disabilities is a national priority for Easterseals who last year provided employment services to more than 70 000 jobseekers from across the country We were pleased that the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA included Easterseals supported provisions to help increase competitive integrated employment opportunities for students and adults with disabilities WIOA Section 404 defined competitive integrated employment by establishing practical and measurable criteria related to earnings and location For example WIOA required that competitive integrated employment be compensated at no less than the minimum wage and be performed at locations where the employee with disabilities interacts with individuals without disabilities to the same extent that individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with other persons However the Department s 2016 WIOA regulation went well beyond the congressionally agreed upon statutory definition of competitive integrated employment by prescribing additional regulatory sub requirements The 2016 regulatory definition requires that the interaction between employees with disabilities and individuals without disabilities be dissected down to the work unit which has the effect of excluding typical community jobs such as custodial landscaping and food service crews that often pay well above minimum wage Easterseals Western and Central Pennsylvania asks that you modify the current regulatory definition of competitive integrated employment by restating the statutory definition instead which I have included below for your reference WIOA STATUTORY DEFINITION P L 113 128 Page 1633 5 COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT The term competitive integrated employment means work that is performed on a full time or part time basis including self employment A for which an individual i is compensated at a rate that I aa shall be not less than the higher of the rate specified in section 6 a 1 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 29 U S C 206 a 1 or the rate specified in the applicable State or local minimum wage law and bb is not less than the customary rate paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by other employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who are similarly situated in similar occupations by the same employer and who have similar training experience and skills or II in the case of an individual who is selfemployed yields an income that is comparable to the income received by other individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are self employed in similar occupations or on similar tasks and who have similar training experience and skills and ii is eligible for the level of benefits provided to other employees B that is at a location where the employee interacts with other persons who are not individuals with disabilities not including supervisory personnel or individuals who are providing services to such employee to the same extent that individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with other persons and C that as appropriate presents opportunities for advancement that are similar to those for other employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who have similar positions Thank you for your consideration of our request Please don t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions Sincerely James G Bennett

stop along the way from the campus security police to the university administration to the local police should be involved in the process of catching and prosecuting the perpetrators All too often colleges have been male preserves where crimes against women were hidden and denied all to protect these junior rapists No more The protections for assault victims put in place by the Obama administration should remain and any changes to them should be turned back Women who have been victimized by sexual assault on campus should not be shamed turned away scorned or otherwise made to feel a double assault one by a man the other by a system run by men Women are becoming the majority on college campuses and that is a good thing Let them know you ve got their backs Keep the regs lose the

with other parts of the regulation longstanding practice and technical guidance Limits the ability of state Vocational Rehabilitation VR program counselors to best determine the needs and competitive

on defining the typically found in the community component of Competitive Integrated Employment and discriminate against non profit employers Community rehabilitation providers of persons with disabilities Federal Register Vol 81 No 161 Friday August 19 2016 Rules and Regulations Page 55643 As explained earlier businesses established by community rehabilitation programs or any other entity for the primary purpose of employing individuals with disabilities do not satisfy this criterion and are therefore not considered integrated settings because these are not within the competitive labor market The factors that generally would result in a business being considered not typically found in the community include 1 The funding of positions through Javits Wagner O Day Act JWOD contracts 2

Counsel Hilary Malawer Of course a self serving idiot who demeans handicapped people brags that he could shoot somebody in broad daylight without incurring political damage grabs women by the private parts claims he avoided a billion dollars of tax liability because I m smart as opposed to being a business failure and lies daily often multiple times in the same day couldn t care less about civil rights of other people All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary Far from being burdensome current civil rights rules and regulations benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that when followed allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity It s a pity that our idiot in chief hasn t appointed someone who is competent to oversee such matters Instead his appointee is a bible beating self serving billionaire just like the idiot who appointed her and is more concerned with raiding public money for her for profit educational policies and Christian values than truly ministering to the rights and needs of students I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Keith

                                                 Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer My second son was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome near the end of eighth grade Until that diagnosis was made he was often the target of bullying Life was miserable for him it was difficult for him to learn and it was excruciating for me as a parent to observe what was happening and have little that I could do to assist him My son is now 38 and is a success story Once he was diagnosed we knew what we were dealing with and his diagnosis provided assistance and protection that he did not previously have If he had not received a diagnosis that provided this protection I fear that he would not be the educated successful person that he is There are many other young people who have a difficult time in school through no fault of their own their sexual orientation gender identity race or disability Some schools will protect and provide for these children but not all will That is why I feel so strongly that we need to preserve the current guidance I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Judy Jerde Saint Paul

 Federal regulations and non regulatory guidance help states and school districts fully implement the laws such as the IDEA ESSA and WIOA which are critical to ensuring students with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other kid Stakeholders rely on these authorities to assist them in understanding and complying with the statutes As such none should be modified or rescinded by the Administration As a citizen I firmly stand behind the laws listed below and their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to ensuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families I urge you not to modify or rescind any Civil Rights Act of 1964 Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for Americas children including students with disabilities I write to urge you not to repeal replace or modify any of the regulations or guidance that ensure they are implemented

receive the benefits of an excellent education EVERY CHILD This promotes not only the well being of every future adult citizen but the viability of our country as a well functioning democracy All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary Far from being burdensome current civil rights rules and regulations benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that when followed allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Leah

your important job to protect and educate college students They need to know what sexual assault is how to void it and what to do if they should fall victim to sexual assault Please do not reverse regulations that have brought attention to what had been a growing crime on campuses I have been a college educator for over 30 years and know the devastating effect sexual assault has on both the one assaulted and the one perpetuating and punished for the crime Getting information to college students is critical and the regulations that require information and investigation of sexual assault are necessary We cannot allow such crimes to be part of the college experience We need safe campuses at such critical times in the lives of students Thank you Virginia Stahl Ph D Vice President Emeritus

          Title IX is a crucial tool for holding perpetrators of sexual violence accountable for their decisions and actions As a psychotherapist working with survivors of sexual trauma I have seen first hand the impact that finding some for of justice have for survivors and their families According to RAINN two out of three sexual assaults go unreported Based on these astonishingly low reporting rates survivors can only benefit from an additional reporting option a unique right that Title IX provides for victims of gender based violence Our current rape culture perpetuates the myth that false reporting is common however widely accepted rate of false reporting range from 2 8 a statistic that is consistent with other crimes Title IX guidance has established the foundation of a workable effective and fair system Implementation takes time and there is still work to be done The solution is to keep and enforce Title IX guidance while continuing to improve upon it by Supporting schools in development of equitable and transparent procedures increasing participation in high quality training and adopting best practices in student conduct policies processes prevention and

classroom teacher for the past 30 years I believe all children deserve a great education and to feel safe and welcomed in their classrooms When a school or a school district doesn t treat students fairly and allows discrimination civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have regulations or rules and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve Our education system is unfair to too many students and communities Students who are Black Latino Asian American Native American immigrants English learners girls LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them I oppose any effort to rescind modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws As a teacher for 30 years I have seen the positive changes these laws have brought about for students When I first started teaching in 1987 English Learners were extremely marginalized One of my friends who attended school during this time joked that he had became such a good artist because all he did was sit in the back of the room and color Laws passed to be inclusive of English Learners have resulted in the requirement to make curriculum accessible to ALL students regardless of the language they speak upon arrival at our schoolhouse door Thanks to these laws many districts now have robust Dual Language Immersion programs where not only do children who come to school speaking a language other than English leave school as fluent bilinguals students who come to school speaking only English also leave school as fluent bilinguals This is a resource that is sorely needed in our country I have also seen as a former student the positive effects of civil rights law in education A simple example prior to Title IX passage the young women on our high school basketball team were using balls labeled Boys Practice during games discarded balls from the boys basketball team Girls and young women are entitled to equal treatment at school as boys They are also entitled to be protected from sexual assault While I do not support a lack of due process for young men who are accused of sexual assault historically the problem has not been that it has been that assault is underreported by young women and when it is reported is often swept under the rug It has been disturbing to hear talk of going back to a time when women are treated as lesser than and not listened to or believed when they report a sexual assault As a fellow female I would think you would understand how critically important it is for young women to minimally feel physically safe while attending school It s the Department of Education s job to help our nation s schools provide high quality education for all children America should be a place where every child no matter their unique challenges their unique needs or where they come from can grow up to be what they dream

students I believe this law has matched with part II of the six identifiers as laid out in this document this law is ineffective This law has become involved in sexual assault and rape cases on college campuses As part of this involvement there has been an consistent inability of college campuses to appropriately deal with those accused of sexual assault on multiple occasions Male students who are most often accused of sexual assault have been subject to harassment oftentimes endorsed by college faculty members who as a person in an institution receiving federal funds have an obligation to enforce equal treatment regardless of sex or gender This treatment has not been dealt out equally to members of different sexes and has not been corrected or regulated by Title IX alone Title IX must be modified to protect the rights of the students accused of rape or sexual assault on college campuses equally and provide protection from discriminatory retaliation To this end I would suggest that TItle IX have an additional stipulation added that college campuses that do not adequately protect the rights of the accused on campus should not receive federal funding or should be fined appropriately   \n",

perpetrator of sexual assault guilty on college campuses it would make sexual assault and other gender based discrimination THE ONLY campus conduct to require that much proof all other offenses require just over 50 proof If you know anything about gender based violence you know that it is FAR harder to provide proof for because of the nature of the offense police and health care often fail survivors and many assaults are not violent enough to leave visible evidence that does not mean that they are not assaults Please see the fault in this Please stop protecting perpetrators of sexual violence Please leave Title IX as it is while our country s colleges and universities are just getting accustomed to these relatively new policies If you are of the belief that police and the judicial system do better by survivors than schools can read the literature Read the personal stories of survivors The news will not present you with every time this country fails a survivor only when a story goes the way of the perpetrator or a case is mishandled Schools are training investigators and these exact processes are not taken lightly on college campuses because of the current Title IX policies

Kangaroo Court administered by his university The school should lose their federal funding for the obviously biased investigation that they did Because of the Dear Colleague Letter I am out nearly 100K and my son still can t get the label of rapist off his reputation Fix it There is no doubt that sexual assaults happen but the assumption that girls won t lie is nonsense Examples are UVA Duke Brandeis Mattress Girl USC Amherst and on and on These false accusers can ruin the accused lives and propel themselves to victimhood with no repercussions when proven to be false Look at Sacred Heart University where FINALLY a false accuser is charged with a crime She ruined two young men s lives and would have normally got off scot free if it was left to the obviously incompetent administrators

Working with students and parents of students who are deaf blind I see a first hand the benefits that a qualified Intervener can provide to individuals who are in need of such services Unfortunately most people do not understand the role of an Intervener Not all deaf blind students will need an Intervener but those that do should be provided with one who is trained in providing such services

            Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer As an 81 year old daughter granddaughter and wife of teachers and as a white person who grew up in a segregated educational environment I am deeply interested in maintaining current Department of Education civil rights rules and regulations All are important and necessary Far from being burdensome they benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that when followed allow students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Aimee Lee Cheek San

and universities continue their progress in addressing sexual assault and protecting victims There is no doubt that sexual assault on college campuses has been and remains a significant all to common occurence If pressure provided through current regulations and federal guidelines is watered down universities will take that as permission to do less As a result not only will efforts to protect and defend victims stagnate things will in fact get worse More students will be victimized and those victimized will not receive the support they deserve Thank you for your consideration Tom Berg   \n",

Federal regulations and non regulatory guidance help states and school districts fully implement the laws such as the IDEA ESSA and WIOA which are critical to ensuring students with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other kid Stakeholders rely on these authorities to assist them in understanding and complying with the statutes As such none should be modified or rescinded by the Administration As a citizen I firmly stand behind the laws listed below and their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to ensuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families I urge you not to modify or rescind any Civil Rights Act of 1964 Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for Americas children including students with disabilities I write to urge you not to repeal replace or modify any of the regulations or guidance that ensures they are implemented appropriately   \n",

                                                  To US Department of Education Re Proposed Changes to Special Education Regulations With passage of the Individuals with Education Act Every Student Succeeds Act Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act our country has made remarkable progress in ensuring that students with disabilities have the same right to a free and public education and the same access to employment and training opportunities as any other student The move by Secretary of Education DeVos to weaken or remove regulations which protect the rights and opportunities for students with disabilities is shameful I urge the Department to everything in its power to protect the rights of students with disabilities to receive the education and training they need to become valued and contributing members of our nation Providing education and training for individuals with disabilities is not only the morally right thing to do it also a sound economic investment for our nation   \n",

percent of engineers are women and the number of women in computing has fallen from 35 percent in 1990 to just 26 percent today The Office for Civil Rights OCR at the U S Department of Education has a

                     For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for Americas children including students with disabilities I write to urge you not to repeal replace or modify any of the regulations or guidance that ensure they are implemented appropriately   \n",

                     For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education

integrated jobs for people with significant disabilities Is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation longstanding practice and technical guidance Limits the ability of state Vocational Rehabilitation VR program counselors to best determine the needs and competitive job fit for their individual clients with significant disabilities Discriminates against non profit employers of people with significant disabilities Must be revised Selected excerpts that overreach on defining the typically found in the community component of Competitive Integrated Employment and discriminate against non profit employers Community rehabilitation providers of persons with disabilities Federal Register Vol 81 No 161 Friday August 19 2016 Rules and Regulations Page 55643 As explained earlier businesses established by community rehabilitation programs or any other entity for the primary purpose of employing individuals with disabilities do not satisfy this criterion and are therefore not considered integrated settings because these are not within the competitive labor market The factors that generally would result in a business being considered not typically found in the community include 1 The funding of positions through Javits Wagner O Day Act JWOD contracts 2 allowances under the FLSA for compensatory subminimum wages and 3 compliance with a mandated direct labor hour ratio

the Departments 2011 and 2014 Sexual Violence guidance that explains a Schools responsibility to respond effectively to sexual violence against students in accordance with the requirements of Title IX LGBTQ students experience a disproportionate rate of sexual assault Weakening or removing any of the existing protections will compromise the rights of survivors of sexual violence and will have far reaching and long lasting consequences on their lives LGBTQ students need to know that their schools will support them Students should be able to count on their schools support to protect their safety and ensure they have an equal chance at an education The guidance helps schools understand their duty to respond to sexual violence and also recognize that discrimination against transgender students is unlawful I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these protections so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely

statistics say 1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted in college Due to underreporting that number is likely higher My college friend was seriously assaulted raped and sodomized while a freshman and received very little support from the university Her attacker faced minimal reprimand from his fraternity and nothing from the university Her road to personal recovery was long and in some ways because her case was not recognized by the university impossible Victims need the support of Title IX Betsy DeVos concern for the rights of those wrongfully accused is misplaced False reporting makes up only 2 10 of cases and under reporting is a much more pervasive issue63 of rapes are never reported to the police I cannot understand the logic here and I do not support the revision of Title IX

                           Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer Thanks to the Anericans with Dissabilities Act I was able to get the help I needed in college I stand by this KS All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary Far from being burdensome current civil rights rules and regulations benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that when followed allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Kristin Sanders

2011 and 2014 Sexual Violence guidance that explains a Schools responsibility to respond effectively to sexual violence against students in accordance with the requirements of Title IX LGBTQ students experience a disproportionate rate of sexual assault Weakening or removing any of the existing protections will compromise the rights of survivors of sexual violence and will have far reaching and long lasting consequences on their lives LGBTQ students need to know that their schools will support them Students should be able to count on their schools support to protect their safety and ensure they have an equal chance at an education The guidance helps schools understand their duty to respond to sexual violence and also recognize that discrimination against transgender students is unlawful I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these protections so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Katherine Peters

Regulation ID ED 2015 OSERS 001 1167 State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program State Supported Employment Services Program Limitations on Use of Sub Minimum Wage The values and rights we have always held in the U S provide that we have the ability to determine our own future and CHOICE in our employment is crucial to this This right should apply equally to those with disabilities These regulations as proposed Limit individual CHOICE and rights of those with disabilities will eliminate or decrease job creation will not contribute to a healthier economy or community These regulations will have a significant effect on those with disabilities and their families It is challenging enough to find and maintain work when you have a disability and we do not need to add regulation that makes this more challenging Additionally as a society it is in our best interests economically to have more of our citizens employed and happy not less Please allow individuals under the age of 24 to choose a Community Rehabilitation Program that offers training using the 14C special wage certificate Please eliminate definitions and provisions that go beyond the intent of Congress in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that would have an adverse effect on The Ability One and State set aside programs and to Community Rehabilitation Programs Thank you for your consideration on this

300 34 Related Services 300 34 Related services Modify by inserting the following after Interpreting services Intervener services means services provided by a qualified intervener that enables a child with deafblindness to receive FAPE by facilitating access to visual and auditory information communication and interaction in the child s mode of communication and instruction needed to learn and make meaningful educational progress In my personal experience my son is forever changed for the better for having his intervener She was able to work with him and communicate with him in ways that he was finally able to understand He went from being somewhat agitated and slightly aggressive to becoming much more calm and willing once he had someone who was able to really understand what his needs were Without his intervener I honestly don t know if he would ve ever been able to make the progress he has made to this day This should be an included covered service for all deaf blind children   \n",

Services I request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services As a practicing school psychologist trainer of school psychologists and as a professional who has spent the last 12 years researching and assisting families of children and youth who are deafblind I cannot think of a better modification to the regulations than to include Intervener Services Interveners provide true access to the curriculum environment and school setting academic social emotional and beyond There related service in other countries with established intervener services has resulted in outstanding advancements for this low incidence population Certification programs already exist to support the development of interveners to ensure qualified professionals are available An intervener assists the student who presents with a combined vision and hearing loss to their unique ways of learning in the educational setting They provide access to instruction happening in the classroom by the primary teacher which may otherwise be missed or not accessible access to social relationships and gains in adaptive behavior and access to information in their environment that allows for incidental learning Much of our learning occurs outside of the general instruction and through interactions throughout the school day Having access to this plethora of information in our everyday environments can make significant gains in academic social adaptive and behavioral skills resulting in students who graduate with accessibility to employment and

education I believe that the states know their educational needs better than the federal government does and the ESSA accomplishes this by giving more control to the states and school districts in determining the standards that students are held to Under the ESSA states are also allowed to handle underperforming schools in the best interest of the state rather than a uniform federal guideline

  Current federal regulations and guidance help all studentsregardless of sex race color sexual orientation gender identity national origin or disability statusreceive the benefit of our civil rights laws That is why I am urging the Department of Education not to repeal replace or modify current civil rights regulations The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents such as the guidance on sexual harassment including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence racial and disability based harassment access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners Federal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex Title IX race color and national origin Title VI and disability Americans with Disabilities Act Rehabilitation Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act To be effective however the federal government must enforce the law provide oversight and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized Current regulations and guidance help make students rights a reality and must be maintained

Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program State Supported Employment Services Program Limitations on Use of Sub minimum Wage The regulation is adverse to The Ability One and State set aside programs and to Community Rehabilitation Programs by adding definitions and provisions that go beyond the intent of Congress in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and thus will result in a loss of jobs for individuals with disabilities All individuals have the right to choose where they work Having a disability doesn t change that It s as simple as that There is no need to complicate things

survivors of sexual assault on college campuses Studies prove survivors who are supported immediately after assault experience less post traumatic shock symptoms I have supported survivors as a volunteer Confidential Sexual Violence Advocate and confirm that this service is of immense value There is no reasonable argument against providing treatment for trauma To roll back protections would be irresponsible and unethical Sexual assault on college campuses can adversely impact completion of higher education The least an assault survivor deserves is support in recovering from this

education for America s children including students with disabilities I write to urge you not to repeal replace or modify any of the regulations or guidance that ensure they are implemented appropriately My nephew Albert was born with a hearing loss and wasn t diagnosed until the age of 5 When he was to attend high school a large school of 3 000 students my family was concerned that he would not get the proper accommodations at such a large school We were represented by an education lawyer and the school district agreed to provide funding for my nephew nephew to attend a high school in Westchester County New York as the school had a special program for the deaf and hard of hearing Albert thrived in this environment academically and had many good friends with like disabilities When it came to College my nephew attended Rochester Institute of Technology and was admitted into the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at RIT My nephew maintained a respectable B grade point average At RIT Albert met his fiancee I couldn t imagine what my nephew s life would be like if he didn t receive the academic accommodations that were so critical to him and life changing There are many children whose future depends on their getting the proper accommodations in their school district and as for my nephew attending a different school when accommodations aren t available at their local school Our country should give every student with a disability the chance to compete on a level playing field working with administration and teachers that are familiar with the needs of students with particular disabilities Please support laws that help students to achieve and thrive academically and socially and eventually professionally Respectfully submitted Joseph L Guagliano

       "      <td>I sit and look at our family photo taken two days before my son returned to college just after Thanksgiving What happened next was a life changing event for all of us My goal is to show you the lack of due process how biased unfair and impartial the college system is as well as how my son was not allowed to be heard once he was wrongly accused of breaking the sexual misconduct policy on his college campus At approximately 1 00am Monday morning 11 28 there was a knock on my son s college door He was handed a No Contact order with a particular student He was not told why where when or what this was about The next day my son was called into the Associate Dean of Student s Senior Deputy Title IX Director s Dean Deputy office and told there was a sexual misconduct against him on the eve of 11 21 in his townhouse No other information was offered at this time He was told he could make a statement at a later date My son was upset angry and did not understand what was going on He was allowed to go to class but was pulled out of class again to talk with the Dean Deputy He was now told he had been suspended The Dean Deputy escorted him to meet up with two Residential Directors all three men then escorted my son to his townhouse and off campus While being escorted off campus signs were being hung on all the buildings warning there was a sexual assault Everyone on campus was emailed and notified at this time This information was released to the newspapers and media You could read the headlines or watch it on the news Sexual assault on XXX College campus Imagine how you would feel your friends watching you be escorted away like a criminal You don t even know why this is happening you only know they did not want to hear your side of the story The next day my husband and son were allowed to return to the campus to get some more things They spoke with the Title IX director about the unfair treatment of our son The Title IX director stated that there was a lot of pressure from the Federal Government and that this is just how things work Four days later Thursday 12 1 16 it was explained to my son that there was inappropriate touching with provided examples by the Dean Deputy he also told my son he did not get confirmative consent The Dean Deputy states he had not read the complaint but had a general idea of the issue and he will not provide any information from the statement He explains they will take statements from my son the complainant and witnesses putting together a case book so that if my son is then charged he would be notified of the charges and given an outcome of investigation My son could then review those materials and write an impact statement The Dean Deputy then confirmed with my son that when they had met yesterday he had informed my son he was being emph charged with sexual misconduct He states he provided this information so my son now could decide what to do We asked the Dean Deputy if we were in the Formal process His response was yes there is a formal process in place we are involved in an investigation at this time The Dean Deputy told us he is not investigating and in no way shape or form does he have anything to do with the conclusion The Dean Deputy is confusing telling my son he is charged with sexual misconduct and indicating we are in a formal process and an investigation It sounds like the Dean Deputy has already determined my son is charged and he is being treated as guilty How can we not feel that the college is biased against our son That afternoon 12 1 at 3 37 pm my son received an email we now need to provide a statement and a list of witnesses by Monday 12 5 Is four days reasonable to provide a statement on a sexual misconduct charge Especially knowing any statement made emph could be used against my son in a criminal case We were also reminded in an email by the college whether you choose to submit a statement or decline to college policy misconduct process will proceed Typically if you do not participate in the college process silence results in a responsible finding and you are often expelled What kind of choice is this We are allowed a lawyer but they can only serve in an advisory role and may not directly represent policy my son How can we find someone to help us quickly and respond within a four day deadline with two of the days being a weekend We were fortunate and did find a lawyer My son submitted a statement Monday 12 5 Now we wait Thursday 12 15 we receive the Notice of Outcome The charge is rape and fondling How did we go from inappropriate touching to this My son was never unclothed there was no intercourse oral sex drugs or alcohol Texts submitted by my son show she was ambivalent and was putting pressure on herself She stated Like you know that I just got out of a relationship so I m really weird with the pace of stuff for us and I m not ready for a lot of stuff and I m a pain in the ass and lk I told you not to expect anything but I feel like you do My son s reply to this was I don t expect anything and honestly if u just want to be friends for a couple of weeks would that make u feel better Like until u feel ur ready for more My son was concerned about this girls feelings Two days later and the day in question it seems she is pursuing him Do you like lace My bra and underwear are even prettier is your room mate going to be there then maybe you ll get lucky She undressed herself my son remained clothed He is being charged with rape The college states the Notice of Outcome is as follows This document shall consist of a summary of allegations emph a summary of the evidence in support of the complaint ldots So in other words this document can only show evidence in support of the victim What if there is evidence that supports the accused How will my son get a fair hearing My son denied the allegations and now the policy states The panel will examine all testimony and documentary evidence emph it deems relevant ldots Here again the college chooses what and what not might be important in this investigation according to them I am scared will they only choose emph evidence that supports the complainant again We are not allowed to know who is on this panel How will we know they are not biased My son did not meet the panel He was not allowed to know who was on the hearing panel He was not asked any questions at any time about the incident by the panel complainant or any investigating persons He was not allowed to ask any questions to the complainant or to the panel Where is his right to be heard Where is the due process and fair and equal treatment that our college promised With such a low standard of evidence required even these basic rights of due process are allowed in civil cases I find it unbelievable that you can be charged with rape and fondling and go through the entire investigation and hearing never once speaking or meeting with anyone about what happened The only way you were able to respond was via email Ninety percent of communication is non verbal My son was found responsible for fondling The Associate VP for Student Life confirmed this We maintain our son s innocence We did not appeal because we were told via email from the college it was possible for the sanctions to be increased with an appeal We also told there is no opportunity to review the investigative file and any additional statements We wanted to defend our son but he was going to be able to graduate What else could we do to defend our son against this biased system We did not feel like we had any good options We also had to strongly consider where we were financially At this point we had already spent 15 640 in just over 2 months We did not file an OCR suit because in reading how to file there was a very limited amount of days and I thought because he accepted the responsibility plea he might not be eligible We were mostly afraid to file before my son would graduate His graduation put us past the deadline You read some of the biases unfair impartial lack of due process or not allowed to be heard examples from my son s experience above Below is a list including more of these that happened in our case How did they determine my son was a threat to the campus when they never asked his side of the story in a he said she said case My son asked the Dean Deputy this and he said he had a right to know but not now They removed him from campus like he was a criminal On a college campus and accusation seems to be equal to a finding of guilt XXX Policy states If any situation is deemed to be an emergency XXX College will utilize its mass notification system to warn the community of any threat It s a mass emergency because a complainant states You just kept trying to kiss me and put your hands in my pants emph or shirt It sounds to me she is unsure of where she was touched The complainant had been home with her mother over the Thanksgiving break The complainant reported her mother said she just needed to be more careful with boys The mother instinct is to protect her daughter if she had noted a change in daughter s behavior or witnessed anything unusual or alarming the mother would not be making the statement reported Text messages submitted by the complainant herself show she was not sure she was assaulted She was not drinking or incapacitated in any way but yet she does not know When my husband asked the Title IX director about the unfair treatment of our son she replied that there was a lot of pressure from the federal government and that this is just how things work Wow we did not know the impact of this statement when keeping notes about what happened the first few days This statement alone shows the pressure these colleges are feeling from the Federal government Is it fair and impartial to be given a no contact order and not told why what where or when Sanctions were administered before any review of the case I question the college s ability in how to implement their own policy The college states the Title IX Response team will conduct an initial assessment within 72 hours and they will then decide if this should be referred for formal or informal resolution My son was removed from campus just 13 hours after receiving the no contact order and in less than 5 hours of being told he violated the sexual misconduct policy This is adequate notice fair and impartial treatment It seems like the college skipped some steps there was no 72 hour assessment It felt like now you are guilty The policy states Title IX Response team receives annual training in strategies emph to protect parties who experience sexual misconduct to promote individual and institutional accountability When you are trained to protect the complainant who is protecting the accused This states the Response team is not only protecting the complainant but the institution Who is protecting my son I thought he was innocent until proven guilty Shouldn t discipline proceedings seek to ascertain the truth not prove guilt or innocence The policy also states the reporting party s expressed preference for resolution in determining the appropriate course of action will be considered Our complainant asked for the no contact order The college issued this not based on fairness they only had one side of the story I thought this was an accusation not a finding of guilt The no contact was issued immediately as soon as she reported it The Dean Deputy issued this order Again he told us he was only being kept apprised of the situation It seems his response and responsibility is to protect the victim It seems biased in this situation due to that lack of evidence and information at the time The Dean Deputy stated on 12 5 that it was not his role to investigate or come to any conclusions The Notice of Outcome states the Deputy Title IX coordinator interviewed the complainant My son did not see the Deputy s interview when he was able to review the redacted copy of the investigation report Why was this not included Why did he tell us this was not his role He came to a conclusion when he issued the no contact to my son I seriously have to question the Dean Deputy roles Both of these roles seem like a conflict of interest On social media he proudly reports that he responds to student conduct related situations supervises and trains students faculty and staff in helping skills sexual harassment prevention mediation and crisis management The Dean Deputy himself emph Selects trains and advises the student Conduct Review Board It seems the Dean Deputy is confusing his roles when he told our son he was guilty before the investigation was completed He is selecting training and advising whoever is on our hearing panel In the summary that will go to the panel the Title IX director writes the complainant as submitting the text You can t do that stuff You can t hold me down and force yourself on me There was no actual text message supplied stating this It may have been a statement made by the complainant but this is misleading The lead investigating officer s daughter was noted to be friends with the complainant This seems like a major conflict We have the connection through Facebook He also wrote a chapter in one of The Previous Title IX directors book see below The complainant s story is not consistent For example the ex boyfriend indicates the complainant reported to him that she did not want to be kissed or touched by the respondent as evident in the following quote from his interview he respondent started trying to kiss her and she had said she did not want any type of sexual relations with him However that night in the incident report and in one of the residential director s reports the complainant indicates kissing was ok She also reports to the Title IX director the next day she was ok with kissing Lets not forget her sexually specific text messaging indicating my son might get lucky The report shows the complainant would not report or make a complaint until she had asked the ex boyfriend s opinion on what she should do about this situation This is documented by than more that one witness Texts submitted show the complainant explicitly detailing her intent to engage in sexual contact with my son while consent can be withdrawn at any time my son displayed he cared about the complainants feeling and was in no hurry to engage in a sexual relationship My son had submitted his statement on 12 5 by 12 9 my son s roommate had received notice that he would be getting a NEW roommate Its sure feels like the school has determined my son will be guilty The Previous Title IX Director wrote a book about sexual harassment while employed our college This book showcased our college as a model for how to set up a Title IX campus Many contributors to the book were college staff members that are still employed at the college The author writes Sexual Violence is a complex epidemic emph whose eradication from our campuses is a daunting yet feasible goal She is highly active for victim s rights in sexual assault and harassment How can she or a campus Title IX program under this leadership be supportive to someone who is accused Even after she left her legacy continues with all those she trained Eradication is a powerful word See the separate list of programs at our college that are tied in with sexual assault violence harassment or victim s rights The Assistant Director of Student Life cc d in the our son s case email s writes about a Trauma Informed Approach It guides us to approach all students as though they have experienced abuse emph regardless of whether they have or not Believe the Victim is appropriate for support but has no place in an investigation or hearing He tweets he does RA training More biased staff Was the college feeling more pressure to find the accused responsible In May of the year my son was accused it was reported filed an ex student who had been a victim at our college was suing our college citing rape That month there was another sexual assault on the campus reported in the newspapers One month before our son s accusation a visitor was arrested by the police for a sexual assault on his campus All these cases bring negative attention to the college and the colleges in turn feel they need to show the public they are protecting victims Believe the victim no matter what has created a system that does not allow an accused person a way to defend him or herself Believe the victim is important in a supportive role but does Not belong in an investigation No one wants to see anyone harmed however it seems those accused are guilty on accusation The new Title IX director hired is a lawyer She told us there is a lot of pressure from the Federal Government The college has to be concerned with losing their Federal Grant money How does a panel make a life altering decision without ever meeting talking or interacting with the parties involved It seems when you are labeling someone as a sex offender you would want to know that you made the right decision you would want the truth It is equally as important to get this right for the victim We all know most communication is non verbal My son struggled when he was removed from campus causing him to miss one week of intense classes right before finals I can t tell you how important it was for him to be home at this time He was so upset about missing his classes it was overwhelming to try to make this work up while trying to respond in 4 days to a sexual misconduct charge His doctor gave him a medical leave of absence however the school did not accept this We were told since it was a week before final exams they would not accept this He was offered no emotional support They stated they would help my son academically however he did not really get any academic help until after this entire process was completed My son could not fully recover his fall grades We do not know how this still might impact his future The following list is Programs at our college that involves intervention training programs on Sexual Assault Violence Harassment Bystander Intervention Program XXX College Antiviolence Task Force faculty staff students XXX College Recognize Report Prevent Campaign Social Norms Campaign Campus Climate Survey Student produced videos One Billion Rising emph Weekly emails to XXX Community Celebrating active bystanders consent checklist ldots Mission meets Practice Mandatory Active bystander training programming All incoming students RA s orientation leaders Inclusion of active bystander messaging into related Title IX training programs for athletes RA s campus employees XXX College Human Rights Policy this investigates and adjudicates reports of sexual violence This is given to all on campus XXX College Welfare of the Community Policy A kin to amnesty policy can report without getting into trouble Residence Hall Programs active bystander messaging and pro social behaviors XXX Center for Women Student led advocacy issues related to violence against women PEEP s Peer Education and Empowerment Program to educate students about sexual and relationship violence Community wide awareness raising and survivor support events One Billion Rising Operation Red Zone Red Flag Campaign Clothes Line Project Take Back the Night White Ribbon Campaign You can see the students and staff are inundated with material on Sexual assault violence and harassment on regular basis This confronts them every time they turn around They are being brainwashed with this stuff So why are the statistics always increasing Why isn t this problem getting better with all this education I know they say under reporting What about the fact that rape no longer means rape The Campus Climate is designed to capture every incident The CDC reports sexual violence includes attempted or completed rape sexual coercion unwanted sexual contact and emph non contact experiences like harassment They count non contact experiences thus inflating the statistics to 1 5 Why are we using statistics from a public health perspective versus evidence based studies like the DOJ Rape and Sexual Assault Victimization Among College Age Females 1995 2013 It seems like most of the CDC s studies and reports now come from groups funded by the VAWA and other victims rights groups that all support a public health perspective There is too much bias with this thought process Trained criminal professionals should be handling these investigations Young men s lives should not be decided in a college faculty lounge Investigations done by trained professionals could protect both the accused and the complainant It would remove the potential bias of college administrators faculty students who sit on these panels and are pressured into making the best decision for the college and ultimately their own jobs We are not providing justice to victims or those accused Our college is a perfect example of this While my son was unable to defend himself due to an unfair process in all the ways I outlined it is also not fair for the victim My son was found responsible for fondling however he was allowed to remain on campus in his townhouse and complete his degree It is a small campus and they could be in the library or food court at the same time my son had to make and attempt to avoid the complainant He could not go to the dorm area or take classes she was in It seems the college sanctioned my son in an attempt to please the complainant I have to ask why did the college keep my son on campus If they truly thought he was guilty of rape or something more than minor event he easily would have been removed from campus The victim in this case did not really win either While yes my son was found responsible and sanctioned with a real possibility of changing his future the girl did not win with my son being allowed to stay on campus and graduate The real winner in this situation is the college They feel they pleased the girl with a responsible finding pleased my son allowing him to graduate but most of all they fulfilled their duty to have a finding of responsibility so they can meet the quota needed for them to keep their federal funding and to keep the OCR off their backs We need a system that is unbiased equitable upholds due process is timely allows for the right to be heard and does not use ambiguous definitions President Trump issued and an Executive Order that the Dear Colleague Letter and its current guidance be rescinded I hope to see this happen I also hope to see a review of cases like ours and that they be given the opportunity to be reviewed and rescinded</td>\n",

       "77  I sit and look at our family photo taken two days before my son returned to college just after Thanksgiving What happened next was a life changing event for all of us My goal is to show you the lack of due process how biased unfair and impartial the college system is as well as how my son was not allowed to be heard once he was wrongly accused of breaking the sexual misconduct policy on his college campus At approximately 1 00am Monday morning 11 28 there was a knock on my son s college door He was handed a No Contact order with a particular student He was not told why where when or what this was about The next day my son was called into the Associate Dean of Student s Senior Deputy Title IX Director s Dean Deputy office and told there was a sexual misconduct against him on the eve of 11 21 in his townhouse No other information was offered at this time He was told he could make a statement at a later date My son was upset angry and did not understand what was going on He was allowed to go to class but was pulled out of class again to talk with the Dean Deputy He was now told he had been suspended The Dean Deputy escorted him to meet up with two Residential Directors all three men then escorted my son to his townhouse and off campus While being escorted off campus signs were being hung on all the buildings warning there was a sexual assault Everyone on campus was emailed and notified at this time This information was released to the newspapers and media You could read the headlines or watch it on the news Sexual assault on XXX College campus Imagine how you would feel your friends watching you be escorted away like a criminal You don t even know why this is happening you only know they did not want to hear your side of the story The next day my husband and son were allowed to return to the campus to get some more things They spoke with the Title IX director about the unfair treatment of our son The Title IX director stated that there was a lot of pressure from the Federal Government and that this is just how things work Four days later Thursday 12 1 16 it was explained to my son that there was inappropriate touching with provided examples by the Dean Deputy he also told my son he did not get confirmative consent The Dean Deputy states he had not read the complaint but had a general idea of the issue and he will not provide any information from the statement He explains they will take statements from my son the complainant and witnesses putting together a case book so that if my son is then charged he would be notified of the charges and given an outcome of investigation My son could then review those materials and write an impact statement The Dean Deputy then confirmed with my son that when they had met yesterday he had informed my son he was being emph charged with sexual misconduct He states he provided this information so my son now could decide what to do We asked the Dean Deputy if we were in the Formal process His response was yes there is a formal process in place we are involved in an investigation at this time The Dean Deputy told us he is not investigating and in no way shape or form does he have anything to do with the conclusion The Dean Deputy is confusing telling my son he is charged with sexual misconduct and indicating we are in a formal process and an investigation It sounds like the Dean Deputy has already determined my son is charged and he is being treated as guilty How can we not feel that the college is biased against our son That afternoon 12 1 at 3 37 pm my son received an email we now need to provide a statement and a list of witnesses by Monday 12 5 Is four days reasonable to provide a statement on a sexual misconduct charge Especially knowing any statement made emph could be used against my son in a criminal case We were also reminded in an email by the college whether you choose to submit a statement or decline to college policy misconduct process will proceed Typically if you do not participate in the college process silence results in a responsible finding and you are often expelled What kind of choice is this We are allowed a lawyer but they can only serve in an advisory role and may not directly represent policy my son How can we find someone to help us quickly and respond within a four day deadline with two of the days being a weekend We were fortunate and did find a lawyer My son submitted a statement Monday 12 5 Now we wait Thursday 12 15 we receive the Notice of Outcome The charge is rape and fondling How did we go from inappropriate touching to this My son was never unclothed there was no intercourse oral sex drugs or alcohol Texts submitted by my son show she was ambivalent and was putting pressure on herself She stated Like you know that I just got out of a relationship so I m really weird with the pace of stuff for us and I m not ready for a lot of stuff and I m a pain in the ass and lk I told you not to expect anything but I feel like you do My son s reply to this was I don t expect anything and honestly if u just want to be friends for a couple of weeks would that make u feel better Like until u feel ur ready for more My son was concerned about this girls feelings Two days later and the day in question it seems she is pursuing him Do you like lace My bra and underwear are even prettier is your room mate going to be there then maybe you ll get lucky She undressed herself my son remained clothed He is being charged with rape The college states the Notice of Outcome is as follows This document shall consist of a summary of allegations emph a summary of the evidence in support of the complaint ldots So in other words this document can only show evidence in support of the victim What if there is evidence that supports the accused How will my son get a fair hearing My son denied the allegations and now the policy states The panel will examine all testimony and documentary evidence emph it deems relevant ldots Here again the college chooses what and what not might be important in this investigation according to them I am scared will they only choose emph evidence that supports the complainant again We are not allowed to know who is on this panel How will we know they are not biased My son did not meet the panel He was not allowed to know who was on the hearing panel He was not asked any questions at any time about the incident by the panel complainant or any investigating persons He was not allowed to ask any questions to the complainant or to the panel Where is his right to be heard Where is the due process and fair and equal treatment that our college promised With such a low standard of evidence required even these basic rights of due process are allowed in civil cases I find it unbelievable that you can be charged with rape and fondling and go through the entire investigation and hearing never once speaking or meeting with anyone about what happened The only way you were able to respond was via email Ninety percent of communication is non verbal My son was found responsible for fondling The Associate VP for Student Life confirmed this We maintain our son s innocence We did not appeal because we were told via email from the college it was possible for the sanctions to be increased with an appeal We also told there is no opportunity to review the investigative file and any additional statements We wanted to defend our son but he was going to be able to graduate What else could we do to defend our son against this biased system We did not feel like we had any good options We also had to strongly consider where we were financially At this point we had already spent 15 640 in just over 2 months We did not file an OCR suit because in reading how to file there was a very limited amount of days and I thought because he accepted the responsibility plea he might not be eligible We were mostly afraid to file before my son would graduate His graduation put us past the deadline You read some of the biases unfair impartial lack of due process or not allowed to be heard examples from my son s experience above Below is a list including more of these that happened in our case How did they determine my son was a threat to the campus when they never asked his side of the story in a he said she said case My son asked the Dean Deputy this and he said he had a right to know but not now They removed him from campus like he was a criminal On a college campus and accusation seems to be equal to a finding of guilt XXX Policy states If any situation is deemed to be an emergency XXX College will utilize its mass notification system to warn the community of any threat It s a mass emergency because a complainant states You just kept trying to kiss me and put your hands in my pants emph or shirt It sounds to me she is unsure of where she was touched The complainant had been home with her mother over the Thanksgiving break The complainant reported her mother said she just needed to be more careful with boys The mother instinct is to protect her daughter if she had noted a change in daughter s behavior or witnessed anything unusual or alarming the mother would not be making the statement reported Text messages submitted by the complainant herself show she was not sure she was assaulted She was not drinking or incapacitated in any way but yet she does not know When my husband asked the Title IX director about the unfair treatment of our son she replied that there was a lot of pressure from the federal government and that this is just how things work Wow we did not know the impact of this statement when keeping notes about what happened the first few days This statement alone shows the pressure these colleges are feeling from the Federal government Is it fair and impartial to be given a no contact order and not told why what where or when Sanctions were administered before any review of the case I question the college s ability in how to implement their own policy The college states the Title IX Response team will conduct an initial assessment within 72 hours and they will then decide if this should be referred for formal or informal resolution My son was removed from campus just 13 hours after receiving the no contact order and in less than 5 hours of being told he violated the sexual misconduct policy This is adequate notice fair and impartial treatment It seems like the college skipped some steps there was no 72 hour assessment It felt like now you are guilty The policy states Title IX Response team receives annual training in strategies emph to protect parties who experience sexual misconduct to promote individual and institutional accountability When you are trained to protect the complainant who is protecting the accused This states the Response team is not only protecting the complainant but the institution Who is protecting my son I thought he was innocent until proven guilty Shouldn t discipline proceedings seek to ascertain the truth not prove guilt or innocence The policy also states the reporting party s expressed preference for resolution in determining the appropriate course of action will be considered Our complainant asked for the no contact order The college issued this not based on fairness they only had one side of the story I thought this was an accusation not a finding of guilt The no contact was issued immediately as soon as she reported it The Dean Deputy issued this order Again he told us he was only being kept apprised of the situation It seems his response and responsibility is to protect the victim It seems biased in this situation due to that lack of evidence and information at the time The Dean Deputy stated on 12 5 that it was not his role to investigate or come to any conclusions The Notice of Outcome states the Deputy Title IX coordinator interviewed the complainant My son did not see the Deputy s interview when he was able to review the redacted copy of the investigation report Why was this not included Why did he tell us this was not his role He came to a conclusion when he issued the no contact to my son I seriously have to question the Dean Deputy roles Both of these roles seem like a conflict of interest On social media he proudly reports that he responds to student conduct related situations supervises and trains students faculty and staff in helping skills sexual harassment prevention mediation and crisis management The Dean Deputy himself emph Selects trains and advises the student Conduct Review Board It seems the Dean Deputy is confusing his roles when he told our son he was guilty before the investigation was completed He is selecting training and advising whoever is on our hearing panel In the summary that will go to the panel the Title IX director writes the complainant as submitting the text You can t do that stuff You can t hold me down and force yourself on me There was no actual text message supplied stating this It may have been a statement made by the complainant but this is misleading The lead investigating officer s daughter was noted to be friends with the complainant This seems like a major conflict We have the connection through Facebook He also wrote a chapter in one of The Previous Title IX directors book see below The complainant s story is not consistent For example the ex boyfriend indicates the complainant reported to him that she did not want to be kissed or touched by the respondent as evident in the following quote from his interview he respondent started trying to kiss her and she had said she did not want any type of sexual relations with him However that night in the incident report and in one of the residential director s reports the complainant indicates kissing was ok She also reports to the Title IX director the next day she was ok with kissing Lets not forget her sexually specific text messaging indicating my son might get lucky The report shows the complainant would not report or make a complaint until she had asked the ex boyfriend s opinion on what she should do about this situation This is documented by than more that one witness Texts submitted show the complainant explicitly detailing her intent to engage in sexual contact with my son while consent can be withdrawn at any time my son displayed he cared about the complainants feeling and was in no hurry to engage in a sexual relationship My son had submitted his statement on 12 5 by 12 9 my son s roommate had received notice that he would be getting a NEW roommate Its sure feels like the school has determined my son will be guilty The Previous Title IX Director wrote a book about sexual harassment while employed our college This book showcased our college as a model for how to set up a Title IX campus Many contributors to the book were college staff members that are still employed at the college The author writes Sexual Violence is a complex epidemic emph whose eradication from our campuses is a daunting yet feasible goal She is highly active for victim s rights in sexual assault and harassment How can she or a campus Title IX program under this leadership be supportive to someone who is accused Even after she left her legacy continues with all those she trained Eradication is a powerful word See the separate list of programs at our college that are tied in with sexual assault violence harassment or victim s rights The Assistant Director of Student Life cc d in the our son s case email s writes about a Trauma Informed Approach It guides us to approach all students as though they have experienced abuse emph regardless of whether they have or not Believe the Victim is appropriate for support but has no place in an investigation or hearing He tweets he does RA training More biased staff Was the college feeling more pressure to find the accused responsible In May of the year my son was accused it was reported filed an ex student who had been a victim at our college was suing our college citing rape That month there was another sexual assault on the campus reported in the newspapers One month before our son s accusation a visitor was arrested by the police for a sexual assault on his campus All these cases bring negative attention to the college and the colleges in turn feel they need to show the public they are protecting victims Believe the victim no matter what has created a system that does not allow an accused person a way to defend him or herself Believe the victim is important in a supportive role but does Not belong in an investigation No one wants to see anyone harmed however it seems those accused are guilty on accusation The new Title IX director hired is a lawyer She told us there is a lot of pressure from the Federal Government The college has to be concerned with losing their Federal Grant money How does a panel make a life altering decision without ever meeting talking or interacting with the parties involved It seems when you are labeling someone as a sex offender you would want to know that you made the right decision you would want the truth It is equally as important to get this right for the victim We all know most communication is non verbal My son struggled when he was removed from campus causing him to miss one week of intense classes right before finals I can t tell you how important it was for him to be home at this time He was so upset about missing his classes it was overwhelming to try to make this work up while trying to respond in 4 days to a sexual misconduct charge His doctor gave him a medical leave of absence however the school did not accept this We were told since it was a week before final exams they would not accept this He was offered no emotional support They stated they would help my son academically however he did not really get any academic help until after this entire process was completed My son could not fully recover his fall grades We do not know how this still might impact his future The following list is Programs at our college that involves intervention training programs on Sexual Assault Violence Harassment Bystander Intervention Program XXX College Antiviolence Task Force faculty staff students XXX College Recognize Report Prevent Campaign Social Norms Campaign Campus Climate Survey Student produced videos One Billion Rising emph Weekly emails to XXX Community Celebrating active bystanders consent checklist ldots Mission meets Practice Mandatory Active bystander training programming All incoming students RA s orientation leaders Inclusion of active bystander messaging into related Title IX training programs for athletes RA s campus employees XXX College Human Rights Policy this investigates and adjudicates reports of sexual violence This is given to all on campus XXX College Welfare of the Community Policy A kin to amnesty policy can report without getting into trouble Residence Hall Programs active bystander messaging and pro social behaviors XXX Center for Women Student led advocacy issues related to violence against women PEEP s Peer Education and Empowerment Program to educate students about sexual and relationship violence Community wide awareness raising and survivor support events One Billion Rising Operation Red Zone Red Flag Campaign Clothes Line Project Take Back the Night White Ribbon Campaign You can see the students and staff are inundated with material on Sexual assault violence and harassment on regular basis This confronts them every time they turn around They are being brainwashed with this stuff So why are the statistics always increasing Why isn t this problem getting better with all this education I know they say under reporting What about the fact that rape no longer means rape The Campus Climate is designed to capture every incident The CDC reports sexual violence includes attempted or completed rape sexual coercion unwanted sexual contact and emph non contact experiences like harassment They count non contact experiences thus inflating the statistics to 1 5 Why are we using statistics from a public health perspective versus evidence based studies like the DOJ Rape and Sexual Assault Victimization Among College Age Females 1995 2013 It seems like most of the CDC s studies and reports now come from groups funded by the VAWA and other victims rights groups that all support a public health perspective There is too much bias with this thought process Trained criminal professionals should be handling these investigations Young men s lives should not be decided in a college faculty lounge Investigations done by trained professionals could protect both the accused and the complainant It would remove the potential bias of college administrators faculty students who sit on these panels and are pressured into making the best decision for the college and ultimately their own jobs We are not providing justice to victims or those accused Our college is a perfect example of this While my son was unable to defend himself due to an unfair process in all the ways I outlined it is also not fair for the victim My son was found responsible for fondling however he was allowed to remain on campus in his townhouse and complete his degree It is a small campus and they could be in the library or food court at the same time my son had to make and attempt to avoid the complainant He could not go to the dorm area or take classes she was in It seems the college sanctioned my son in an attempt to please the complainant I have to ask why did the college keep my son on campus If they truly thought he was guilty of rape or something more than minor event he easily would have been removed from campus The victim in this case did not really win either While yes my son was found responsible and sanctioned with a real possibility of changing his future the girl did not win with my son being allowed to stay on campus and graduate The real winner in this situation is the college They feel they pleased the girl with a responsible finding pleased my son allowing him to graduate but most of all they fulfilled their duty to have a finding of responsibility so they can meet the quota needed for them to keep their federal funding and to keep the OCR off their backs We need a system that is unbiased equitable upholds due process is timely allows for the right to be heard and does not use ambiguous definitions President Trump issued and an Executive Order that the Dear Colleague Letter and its current guidance be rescinded I hope to see this happen I also hope to see a review of cases like ours and that they be given the opportunity to be reviewed and rescinded"

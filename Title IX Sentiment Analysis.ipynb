       "8157   The 2014 04 29 Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence letter from OCR should be rescinded Schools should not handle sexual assault cases Yes a school is obligated to respond to sexual violence however that response should be to assist the complainant in seeking medical attention preserving evidence and filing a police report In cases of incapacitated force coercion that would result in proper punishment to the perpetrator There are numerous He Said She said cases 90 of cases where both man and woman were drunk their inhibitions were down there were no witnesses because it happened in one of their dorm rooms Many times the complainant refuses to seek health support or the police which directly hampers the school s ability to immediately and appropriately respond When this happens there is no evidence or too much time has past for the witness statements to be relevant Under F 1 please know that adequate reliable and impartial investigations are NOT done Investigations are often times poorly done the investigator is told by the school s board to with bias create the file to benefit the victim The respondent is considered guilty until proven innocent The investigative file is sloppy poorly written No recorded transcripts allowed Both the respondent and complainant are limited to what questions the investigator asks Edited statements for her only The prompt time frame is never followed F 1 is outrageous Preponderance of Evidence standard Sexual assault is a criminal offense and should have the same standard of due process This is why schools have NO BUSINESS holding hearings to determine responsibility for sexual assault F 2 it s not incarceration is inappropriate However for many wrongfully accuse respondents OR the 90 of cases where the complainant and respondent were both drunk and had regrettable sex the result for the respondent is a life crushing expulsion from college which though is not incarceration is a very damaging blow to his life path The most frequently occurring cases are where the man and woman agreed to have sex but then for some reason she wasn t really into it and the next thing you know the man has an assault charge against him Many of these cases involve regret on her part or the realization mid act that she really doesn t want to be doing this In many of these cases withdrawal of consent is NOT given She might be thinking it in her head but she does NOT actively withdraw consent In F 6 OCR should absolutely allow cross examination of a witness Often the woman just has her friends be her witness though in reality there were no witnesses to the actual encounter and her friends simply tell the investigator whatever the complainant told them to say Again the ramifications to the respondent are too big to not allow cross examination of witnesses The guidance of H 2 is ridiculous because most schools knee jerk expel the respondent immediately if found responsible OCR should mandate now that a knee jerk expulsion is discriminatory as each case needs to be handled individually Under J 4 please know that NOWHERE on a campus is there information for the men that if you have regrettable sex one day you could end up being expelled the next day Posters are only geared toward the victim When men get Title IX violation letters they don t even know what the school is talking about For every victim poster that a school puts up another poster should be required that tells the men to not have sex with that drunk girl because it could ruin your life Also please know that many women on campuses these days are equally as horny as the men One night stands are very common on campuses especially where lots of alcohol consumption takes place In all this Q A letter from OCR is out of touch with the reality of what is happening on campuses these days Men are accused sometimes wrongfully but often times in a state of confusion from the woman who didn t really have a good time and the school and her friends have convinced her that she was assaulted A completely bias investigation is done Man has to hire lawyer A hearing board is convened of members fully aware that the directive from the school board is to find all alleged respondents guilty Man is not allowed to talk directly with the complainant though many are He said She said no cross examination of the witnesses A preponderance of evidence standard is used Man is almost always found responsible each hearing treated the same He is knee jerk expelled He files an OCR complaint that he was discriminated against during the process He might sue the school More lawyer fees Woman goes back to class Rescind this letter and write a whole new policy on how schools should handle Title IX sexual assault cases which would be to immediately direct the woman to the health center and the police If she accuses better have good enough reason to tell police   \n",

       "769   To Hilary Malawer Assistant General Counsel Office of the General Counsel RE Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 Evaluation of Existing Regulations I am writing in response to the ED request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda Any regulation guidance technical assistance and or other administrative activity must be whether the regulation guidance advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students I agree with COPAA and believes ED s narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nation s education laws students I make the following recommendations 1 Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws I strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ESEA ESSA Education Amendments Act of 1972 particularly Title IX The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Particularly Section 504 IDEA HEA ADA WIOA PERKINS FOIA and FERPA As this relates to IDEA in particular The Secretary may not implement or publish in final form any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20 1983 particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education least restrictive environment related services timelines attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings or qualifications of personnel except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance 2 Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws 3 Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters 4 Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters DCL that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parent s right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA The letters to rescind are Parent s right to include invite participants to IEP meetings Letter to Anonymous 2003 Letter to Byrd 2003 These letters must be rescinded IDEA 20 U S C 1414 d 1 B vi and the regulations 30 C F R 300 321 a 6 and c allows parents and school district at their discretion to include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent s right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings Parent s and expert s right to observe the child in the classroom Letter to Mamas 2004 This letter must be rescinded As stated above Congress has repeatedly found that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home 601 C 5 To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom To fully participate as members of the IEP team they should have the right to observe the child s education in progress a proposed placement whether accommodations and services are being provided and other matters Independent Education Evaluations IEE The right of the family to include recommendations to the IEP team from the evaluator Letter to LaDolce 2007 This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C F R 300 503 c requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations IEE While the agency state district may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation 34 C F R 300 502 a 2 the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the child s IEP Failure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504 Letter to McKethan 25 IDELR 295 296 OCR 1996 This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA they would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504 The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections   \n",

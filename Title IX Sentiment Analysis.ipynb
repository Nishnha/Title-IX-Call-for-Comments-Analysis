       "11578  Ms Hilary Malawer Assistant General Counsel Office of the General Counsel U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Ave SW Room 6E231 Washington DC 20202 Re Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 Dear Ms Malawer I am commenting on Regulation ID ED 2015 OSERS 001 1167 Date Posted Aug 19 2016 RIN 1820 AB70 CFR 34 CFR Parts 361 363 and 397 Federal Register Number 2016 15980 I currently work as a Customer Service Representative where I serve at the State of New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs and Board of Nursing My job at InspiriTec an affirmative employer of people with disabilities including veterans offers full wages benefits and promotional opportunities Many of my co workers are also persons with disabilities however after working here for 5 weeks started August 14 2017 I see that my co workers and I operate just as any business typically found in the community with an identical focus on job performance and exceeding customers expectations Yet under the current Rehabilitation Services Administration RSA regulations and guidance my employer may not meet the definition of a Competitive Integrated Employment setting which means that all people with disabilities in the future may not have an opportunity to work at InspiriTec and earn competitive wages and career opportunities enjoyed by all of us here It is ironic per RSA guidance that future persons with disabilities may not be supported if they choose to work at InspiriTec simply because many already do work here Many of my coworkers with disabilities have expressed their sense of freedom and empowerment to reach their full potential in an environment where the focus is not on one s disability but rather performing one s job Why deny others this opportunity RSA guidance does not seem to recognize each person has individual needs and that a one standard metric will fail to truly measure quality of life as presupposed by the definition used to describe integrated workplaces The workplace I currently serve recognizes my disability where as my previous job with the Federal Government as a contractor has failed to recognize my psychiatric disorder which was diagnosed on April 2011 Quality of life assumptions such as community integration need to be assessed by the individual s needs and desires and not a one size fits all in an identity group mentality Therefore it is impossible to assign a statistical measure of integration using numbers such as ratios of co workers with disabilities As an affirmative employer of people with disabilities participating in the AbilityOne JWOD Program and state use programs InspiriTec has created thousands of jobs in the IT Help Desk and Contact Center arena since launching in 2001 When referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors cease employment opportunities at my company will go unfilled Deserving individuals with significant disabilities including veterans will be denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our community unless the Department immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance posted on the Department s website related to the definition of integrated settings and issues clarifying guidance that employers participating in the AbililtyOne JWOD Program and state use programs may be considered competitive integrated employment settings I suffers from manic depression anxiety disorder and bipolar depression since 1995 After 8 years with the federal government I was released without notice The federal government has failed to understand or to show consideration for people who suffers from mental illness This has given me a new opportunity to seek help from DVRS and they was able to connect and network with Inspiritec and helped me to gain employment Despite having a strong education background AS degree in Accounting BS degree in Finance and MBA in Management Accounting DVRS and Inspiritec was there to help me Thank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs or inhibit job creation Sincerely LaRAY Hay   \n",

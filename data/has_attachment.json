As I explain in my attached comments, the current definition places pressure on them to adopt veiled racial quotas in special education services, which violates the Constitution.\n\nThe definition comes from the Obama administration's December 19, 2016 rule dealing with grants and assistance under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) governing the Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities program and the Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities program. See Department of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Assistance to States for the Education of Children With Disabilities; Preschool Grants for Children With Disabilities, 81 Fed. Reg. 92376 (Dec. 19, 2016). \n \nThe rule, now found at 34 C.F.R.  300.646 & 300.647, is problematic, because the rule will pressure school districts to violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal-protection clause through its definition of \"significant disproportionality.\" See 34 C.F.R.  300.647 (interpreting 20 U.S.C.  1418(d)(1)'s reference to \"significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity\"); 34 C.F.R. 300.647(a)(1)&(a)(6) (defining disproportionality in terms of comparisons between \"one racial or ethnic group\" and \"all other racial and ethnic groups\").  \n \nThe notice containing the final version of the rule ignored the agency's duty to interpret laws so as to avoid potential constitutional problems. The rule interprets \"significant disproportionality\" as being based on a crude comparison of the number of minorities versus number of whites with a particular outcome or classification - rather than whether the outcome or classification was more accurate for members of one race rather than another due to disproportionate failure to evaluate members of a particular race correctly. The rule compares the \"outcome for children in one racial or ethnic group\" not with the correct outcome, but with the \"outcome for children in all other racial or ethnic groups.\" See 34 C.F.R.  300.647(a)(1)&(a)(6). \n\nThere was a plausible alternative interpretation of \"significant disproportionality\" that did not raise any potential constitutional problem (one focusing on skewed process rather than outcome, such as whether economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to appropriate identification or placement skewed the process against a minority group). \n\nSo there was no reason to adopt the interpretation contained in the rule, which punishes LEA's for not achieving a racial quota in identification of children as disabled. If regulated entities do not achieve \"significant disproportionality,\" even for reasons beyond their control, 15% of their funds are diverted to coordinated, early intervening services. See 34 CFR  300.647(d)&(e).\n \nRacial-balance requirements in special education are unconstitutional. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 538 (7th Cir. 1997) (overturning provision in court \"decree\" that \"limits minority enrollment in compensatory education (that is, remedial) programs to the percentage of minority students in the school as a whole. These programs are designed largely although not entirely for minority students, because they have on average more educational deficits. To forbid these students access to these programs on the ground that it would foster unfavorable stereotypes is the kind of 'benign discrimination' thinking ...that the courts have long rejected\").\n \nSo the rule was wrong to financially penalize school districts for not achieving such racial balance. Doing so ignored settled canons of statutory construction. Statutes should not be interpreted as pressuring regulated entities to use race unless there is no plausible alternative reading of the law. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 923 (1995) (\"Although we have deferred to the [Justice] Department's interpretation in certain statutory cases . . . we have rejected agency interpretations to which we would otherwise defer where they raise serious constitutional questions. . . When the Justice Department's interpretation of the Act compels race-based districting, it by definition raises a serious constitutional question . . . and should not receive deference\"); Lutheran Church v. FCC, 141 F.3d 344 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (pressure on regulated entity to use race was unconstitutional). \n\nPenalizing an entity for not meeting \"racial targets or quotas\" raises \"difficult constitutional questions,\" even when the entity has previously been found guilty of discrimination (which is not the case for the regulated entities subject to this rule). See Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2524 (2015).","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Hans Bader","doc.state":"VA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-5936&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"National Advocacy Organization","doc.comment_body":"Attached, please find comments from The Education Trust.","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Daria Hall","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-5934&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Community Organization","doc.city":"Oakton","doc.comment_body":"Dear Members of the United State Department of Education Regulatory Reform Task Force:\n\nI am writing to request your assistance in reviewing and revoking regulation and guidance, promulgated by USDOE during the last Administration, which is significantly negatively affecting job options for people with disabilities.

I have taught a course on Title IX every year since 2007. I have previously served as Senior Counsel in the Office on Violence Against Women at the US Department of Justice, and prior to that served as an Executive Assistant Attorney General in Illinois.  I worked with the Department of Education in the Obama Administration on its initiatives to address the national problem of campus sexual violence. The Harvard Law School Gender Violence Program contributed to the work of the White House Task Force on Protecting Students from Sexual Assault in 2014. I have worked with students across the country on this problem, helping survivors retain an educational foothold in the aftermath of an assault. I have worked with schools in achieving compliance with Title IX and have lectured extensively on the topic. I also appear in The Hunting Ground, an acclaimed documentary on campus sexual assault.\n\nThe Gender Violence Program partners with Futures Without Violence and the University of Virginia to offer a curriculum on Changing the Narrative on Gender-Based Violence on Campus. It includes best practices on a school's duties to prevent, respond and resolve cases of sexual misconduct under Title IX. We offer this curriculum with a faculty of national experts on violence prevention and provide it regionally across the country. \n\nI have attached two recent articles of mine-one from the Harvard Law Review regarding \"target rapes\" on campus; the other a recent opinion editorial published in the Washington Post. I have other publications available on request.  I am a signatory to the White Paper on the preponderance standard submitted by Professor Nancy Chi Cantalupo and others.\n\nI write to support the OCR DCL of April 2011 and to urge the DOE not to abandon the considerable work it has done to enforce Title IX's important equality guarantees. The DOE should continue advising schools on fair implementation of their responsibilities to prevent and address campus sexual assault. Special rights for the accused is not legally consistent with the civil rights provisions of Title IX. Fair process, as provided for in the 2011 DCL and the Campus SaVE Act, mandates equal treatment for both sides with an emphasis on victim safety, public safety, and offender accountability. Schools must be able to keep their campuses safe for all students. Each of the problems cited by Secretary DeVos to justify scrapping the DCL was a Title IX violation--not a problem caused by compliance with an unfair regulation. It is urgently necessary to work with schools on the fair implementation of policies and procedures to effect Title IX's promise of equal access to educational opportunities. Creating a new evidentiary standard of clear and convincing would be confusing to schools; would create a discriminatory system for sexual violence cases when preponderance of the evidence is the standard for all other civil rights cases; and in itself would create an unnecessary regulatory morass rather than streamlining regulation as requested in this evaluation of existing regulations. Rather, the DOE should work with schools on fair processes as currently required--if one party has a right to present evidence, have counsel, or to appeal, etc.,  so too does the other party. DOE should ensure schools have trained investigators and adjudicators and trauma-informed responses so that a student reporting sexual misconduct is not further harmed in terms of access to educational opportunities. It should help schools to explore resolutions that promote the purpose of Title IX. The building blocks for such important action have been set, and the DOE should continue this work, but not by overreacting to claims of the accused and their academic supporters who imagine having been struck down by a pendulum swing in favor of victims or survivors of sexual assault. For years, sexual offenders were getting away with assaulting other students on campus. If we don't hold offenders accountable, the scourge of sexual violence on college campuses will continue unabated. The 2011 DCL is a critical guidance document to schools to help them achieve compliance with Title IX's civil rights provisions. While the DOE can and should continue to hold schools accountable to provide fair processes, changing substantially the evidentiary standard would signify a retreat on its important enforcement role. Moreover, it would be legally inconsistent with civil rights and anti-discrimination laws, and thus would lead to unnecessary and avoidable excessive litigation. The current comments ask how to reduce regulations--I respectfully submit that such reduction can be achieved by continuing a regulatory framework already in place rather than disrupting it. To do so will subvert the stated purpose of this evaluation of existing regulations. \n\nSee attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Diane Rosenfeld","doc.state":"MA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16332&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Health Justice Project, Loyola University Chicago School of Law","doc.city":"Chicago","doc.comment_body":"Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\n\nMy comments in response to the U.S. Department of Educations request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 are attached. \n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Kate Mitchell","doc.state":"IL","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16316&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Individual","doc.comment_body":"Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\nThe \"Dear Colleague Letter and Resource Guide on ADHD\"\nhttps:\/\/ www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/ocr\/letters\/colleague-201607-504-adhd.pdf\n\nI attached a pdf file with my story","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16309&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Academic\/Think Tank","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Steve Jacobson","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16307&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Academic\/Think Tank","doc.city":"Maple Grove","doc.comment_body":"Education Liberty Watch is submitting the following broad recommendations to decrease the federal role in education back to its constitutional boundaries:\n1) Enforce psychological privacy in federally mandated assessments and other programs and surveys\n2) Protect student privacy by withdrawing the 2012 regulatory changes to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act\n3) Minimize federal control over state standards and assessments\n4) Abolish federal programs that interfere with privacy and parental autonomy\n5) Clarify transgender policies to protect the privacy and safety of all students\n\nDetailed references and information concerning these recommendations are offered in the uploaded document.","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Karen Effrem","doc.state":"MN","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16305&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"none","doc.city":"SALEM","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)Thank you","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"SUSAN FARMER","doc.state":"OR","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16297&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Individual","doc.comment_body":"Please see attached supplemental comments.","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16295&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Duane Morris LLP","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"Aveda Institute Coalition","doc.name":"Katherine Brodie","doc.state":"Law firm","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16270&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Academic\/Think Tank","doc.city":"Ogden","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Stephanie McClure","doc.state":"UT","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16260&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Families Advocating for Campus Equality","doc.city":"San Diego","doc.comment_body":"FR Doc # 2017-13157\nPlease see attached file: FACE REGULATION COMMENTS;

The creation of an effective strategy requires extensive research and consultation with those who possess expertise in many fields, including higher education, sexual violence and the law. \n\nSecretary of Education DeVos has received overwhelming support from across the political spectrum for her plan to \"launch a transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\" Widespread public notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides the architecture for Americans' right to influence rules and regulations that will affect them, their organizations and their livelihoods. It is a method by which agencies are held accountable, and compliance provides assurance that agency decisions are fact-based and objective, and not the result of a particular political or social agenda. \n\nThe Department of Education Office for Civil Rights' (OCR) attempt to resolve campus sexual misconduct issues through guidance such as its April 4, 2011 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" (DCL), without subjecting it to public notice and comment was well-intentioned but imprudent. The fact that the DCL was issued by unelected and unaccountable government officials seeking to change sexual behavior through public policy undoubtedly has lead to the DCL's many shortcomings and devastating unintended consequences.  Many FACE students suspended or expelled following misguided or result-driven disciplinary processes have suffered tremendous emotional, educational and career-destroying impacts traceable to the 2011 DCL.\n\nOCR guaranteed compliance with its directives by subjecting institutions to onerous Title IX investigations, publicizing institutions' names prior to findings of wrongdoing and threatening to withhold their federal funding.  However, the broad responsibilities OCR imposed upon institutions of higher education have been uniformly criticized as unfair, inequitable and generally ineffective at educating students about or preventing sexual misconduct on college and university campuses.  \n\nThe 2011 DCL also neglected to provide campuses with tangible tools to accomplish the broad policy goals it sought to achieve. These omissions are particularly troublesome given the fact-specific nature of most campus sexual misconduct disputes and the importance and extreme difficulty of accurately assessing credibility in \"he said\/she said\" cases, particularly when alcohol is a factor. As such, the DCL's proscribed policies do not assist campus administrators in negotiating the extremely complex issues inherent in investigating and adjudicating campus sexual misconduct disputes. \n\nCourts across the country are increasingly recognizing that schools are not providing the basic fairness one would expect from an institution of higher education and finding that DCL-mandated disciplinary procedures have lead to biased and often predetermined results. There have been nearly seventy decisions in favor of accused students in the past three years, almost thirty of which were decided in 2017 alone.\n\nFACE appreciates your consideration of our suggestions to help ensure campus disciplinary proceedings are transparent and unbiased, and individual disciplinary decisions are not motivated by threats of penalties or political pressure to report a threshold number of sexual assaults. We believe the integrity of campus disciplinary decisions will be ensured and prevention efforts more successful when decisions are based on fair procedures, reasonable and objective behavioral standards and the decision-makers' independent evaluation of all available relevant and reliable evidence.\n\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Cynthia Garrett","doc.state":"CA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16258&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Student","doc.comment_body":"Having spent the last year and a half as the President of Students Advocating for Students - a national, non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to educating college students about their civil liberties - I have become extremely familiar with many of the Department of Education's (DOE) rules, regulations, and policies.

We strongly believe that all students deserve and are entitled to a quality education in an environment free of violence.  Unfortunately, this is not a reality for many students with marginalized identities, especially students who identify as people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, and Muslims.  When a school or school district perpetrates or allows violence, civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in.  In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We fully support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.  Which is why, we oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nThrough our community work, we know firsthand that LGBTQ students face extensive barriers to educational success.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report that found 17.8% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students have been forced to have sexual intercourse compared to 5.4% of heterosexual high school students. The largest national survey examining the experiences of transgender people in the U.S. found that 13% of respondents who were out or perceived as transgender in K-12 were sexually assaulted because of their gender identity. This same report also found that 54% of Transgender K-12 students have experienced verbal harassment, and 24% were physically attacked.  This violence and mistreatment was so pervasive that 17% of transgender students left a K-12 school, and 6% were expelled. For transgender individuals who continued onto college or vocation school, 24% experienced verbal, physical, or sexual harassment during their high education experience. The 2015 AAU Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct determined that 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, and non-conforming) college students have been sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN females, and 4% of non-TGQN males. Any rollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of LGBTQ student survivors, making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they experience their school environments.\n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all students. We urge you not to roll-back these protections. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":"NY","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16177&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=png","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"EveryChild Solutions","doc.city":"Cary","doc.comment_body":"Dear Ms. Malawer:\n\nI am a parent, an education advocate and a member of the Council On Education Services for Exceptional Children (CECAS: NC State Advisory Council).

Today, our 216 local associations in 47 states and the District of Columbia combine programming and advocacy to generate institutional change in the areas of racial justice and civil rights, empowerment and economic advancement of women and girls, and health and safety of women and girls. \n\nIn light of our mission and history, YWCA USA writes today in response to the June 22, 2017, Federal Register request for input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, to urge the U.S. Department of Education to maintain regulations and guidance that we believe are central to meeting its responsibility for protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and disability. \n\nDespite progress in many areas of life, too many of our young people continue to experience barriers to educational success. The Departments rules, regulations, policy guidance, data collection efforts, compliance reviews, and enforcement activities remain critical tools for ensuring that all students receive equal access to educational opportunity in safe and supportive learning environments. This is especially true for students who historically have been marginalized, including students who are African American, Latino, Asian American or Pacific Islander, Native American, immigrant, girls, LGBTQ, English learners, religious minorities, or who have a disability.\n\nYWCA is particularly concerned about the marginalization that girls of color historically have experienced, and that they continue to experience in Americas schools. As described more fully in our policy brief, On a Mission for Girls of Color: Inequality at School, many girls of color experience overly punitive disciplinary responses in public schools that are frequently under-funded, under-resourced, and increasingly segregated by race, ethnicity, and economic status. Such learning environments and the resulting academic achievement gaps that girls of color experience are illustrative of the ways in which they experience significant institutional and structural racism in Americas education system. \n\nTo address these and other concerns, YWCA urges the Department to maintain in full force and effect all regulations and guidance documents that seek to protect students from discrimination on the basis of race color, national origin, sex, and disability, as well as those that seek to improve the academic achievement of disadvantaged students. We are particularly concerned about the negative impact that repeal of the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students and the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX Requirements and How They Relate to Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence would have on students, and urge the Department to maintain these important guidance documents. \n\nAt a time of such rapidly shifting demographic changes, the Department should be affirming rather than paring back the tools and resources that have been developed to protect students from discrimination. Moreover, instead of repealing, replacing, or modifying regulations and guidance documents, the Department should further its commitment to racial and gender equity by bolstering support for the local level school system personnel who bear such important front-line implementation responsibilities. \n\nYWCA appreciates the opportunity to share our views with you. If you have any questions, please contact YWCA USA Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy Catherine Beane, at cbeane@ywca.org or 202-835-2354.\n\nSincerely, \n\nAlejandra Y.

Our story is that millions of families share. I hope you take a moment to read it.\n\nOur family has struggled for 8 years in the public school system to receive accommodations for our bright, ADHD diagnosed son. We had no guide to reference when our child was failing instead of thriving in a great, small, school district. We have had teachers with no idea how to approach our son's differences and blatantly refused accommodations or techniques outside of their standard teaching methods. Simply because they just didn't know how or didn't want to try. We didn't know what to do and no one could explain our rights.\n\nIf the school had this resource, if WE had this resource in our hands to present to the school from the beginning, our son would be a different person today. There are over 1 million people diagnosed with ADHD. How many more children and families are suffering undiagnosed in schools across this country? This will ultimately affect who they will become as adults.\n\nTeachers and schools do not always understand, know how to identify, evaluate, or accept ADHD as a true disability. These children desperately need help in school systems set up to teach one type of brain. Please do not deny parents and educators in the public and charter school system a clear and effective guide to helping students with ADHD succeed. In a world of No Child Left Behind, we are leaving undiagnosed ADHD children behind. Do we want more successful people in our society? Yes. Then let them start on the first day of school.\n\nFor this one story, there are millions that have a similar experience. Families that haven't commented. Families that have no idea this resource is about to be cut. Families that don't know that they will need this one day. They will suffer. Don't take it away.

While I write these comments as a private citizen, I have worked as a therapist and as an advocate for survivors of sexual violence for over five years both at a rape crisis center setting and in a campus setting at UC Berkeley. I am alarmed by how proposed changes will set our country back by silencing survivors and emboldening perpetrators of violence. \n\nThe Dear Colleague Letter has provided the necessary backing to equip colleges to intervene for their community's safety, empower survivors to pursue their educational goals, engage in effective violence prevention, and demonstrate a commitment to addressing and ending sexual violence on their campuses.\n\nColleges are uniquely situated to address its community, culture, and environment to bring an end to sexual violence. Colleges function as microcosms, and the injuries of sexual violence reverberates throughout an expansive community that can include social groups, families, dorms, academic programs, etc. It is essential for universities to be able to address situations where the complainant and respondent share classes or spaces to allow both parties to participate in their education while an investigation is carried out.\n\nPrior to these measures being put in place, I have worked with survivors who had been forced to stop attending classes, transfer schools, or drop out entirely in order to look after their own safety and health. Survivors need to be able to address sexual violence outside of the criminal justice system, and the Title IX process allows them to do so. For many survivors, justice is not about seeking out the prosecution or punishment of their perpetrator. Justice is being able to continue accessing education in the face of traumatic experiences they did not get to choose or control.\n\nProviding a mechanism for colleges to adjudicate incidents of sexual violence utilized the trauma-informed practice of offering survivors choices, which increases reporting overall. Relying solely on the criminal justice system or regional centers to address \"Title IX incident[s] which rises to a criminal level\" is shortsighted and will discourage survivors from coming forward to report.  The most effective way to increase reporting is to offer survivors options. When survivors understand the definitions of sexual violence and understand the school's resources and processes, they are nearly twice as likely to utilize such resources. \n\nSurvivors are often coping with the effects of trauma, which places them at a hindrance when trying to engage law enforcement. In the midst of acute trauma, a survivor's priority is to feel safe and okay, not to collect evidence and make a case for prosecution. Survivors are also required to use their financial resources to pay for expenses related to their assaults, such as their medical care, enrollment and withdrawal fees, counseling, housing, etc. This can create a disproportionate advantage for perpetrators who are able to invest their funds into their legal defense. The preponderance of evidence standard used by the Title IX process addresses these dynamics by placing an equal responsibility on all parties to present their case. The adjudication model adopted by universities also allows for trauma-informed approaches that are not available in the criminal justice system. \n\nImportantly, it must be noted that sexual harassment is a significant issue in colleges. Sexual harassment is not included in criminal codes and can only be addressed through civil remedies which are cost prohibitive and inaccessible to many survivors.\n\nCampuses need to prioritize primary prevention and culture change efforts to bring an end to violence. Using effective primary prevention strategies leads to fewer incidents of people perpetrating harm, and stronger intervention efforts by peers. The Dear Colleague Letter states that schools should \"implement preventive education programs and make victim resources, including comprehensive victim services, available.\" These efforts will ensure that all members of a university community know what values and norms exist on campus, how they may be held accountable for their actions, and how they can access support if they have been impacted by sexual violence.\n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter was vital in sending a message to university administrators and its community: colleges had a stake and a role in addressing sexual violence. Rescinding this letter will have the opposite effect. People who cause harm will know it will be easier to subvert accountability, law, and policy.

This letter articulated several critical ways in which universities can prevent sexual violence from happening in their communities; it is vital that these recommendations and obligations stand as expectations for schools across the country.\n\nWhile I write the following comments as a private citizen, I want to acknowledge that my work at Montana State University and UC Berkeley has strengthened my commitment to violence prevention and survivor support in a university setting. It is widely understood that 1 in 5 female undergraduate students, and 1 in 18 male undergraduate students, will be sexually assaulted while in college. For transgender and gender nonconforming students, sexual assault rates are estimated to be between 1 in 2 and 1 in 4. Looking beyond the numbers, I have seen these statistics play out in real life. I have worked with many students who have been subjected to sexual assault and rape during their time in college. For each and every one of these students, the effects have been devastating. The consequences of experiencing this time of harm range from the short term-- immediate housing needs, medical care, needing to reschedule an exam-- to the long term-- symptoms of PTSD, needing to take time off of school, enforcing and renewing no-contact orders.\n\nWhile Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 underscores the value of education as a civil right, to people of all sexes and genders, it is the Dear Colleague letter that truly connects this civil right to the need to protect students from sexual assault and harassment. Specifically, there are three key areas of the letter and its implications that I feel are particularly important to uphold:\n\n1. Campuses must prioritize primary prevention and culture change efforts, which include widespread activities to raise awareness of resources, policies, and procedures. Promoting education and accurate information about expectations, social norms, and resources allows every student to both be held accountable for their actions and seek support from the appropriate resources should they be impacted by sexual violence.\n\n2. The criminal justice system is imperfect in its very nature, particularly when seen as a solution to sexual violence. Universities have an important opportunity to provide students with safety and healing outside of what the criminal justice system has to offer. It is imperative that survivors have other options available to them to access safety and support. The Title IX reporting process is an important way that institutions can fill these gaps left by the criminal justice system. By taking, investigating, and acting on reports of sexual violence, universities can provide measures and options to students that are tailored to the ways in which sexual violence impacts a student's access to education.\n\n3. By acknowledging the sheer number of people on campuses across the country who have been impacted by sexual violence, institutions can address effects of trauma that are both general and also specific to that community. Doing away with the expectation for universities to address sexual violence would immediately eliminate the ability for those impacted by sexual violence to receive the specific support they need based on their situations and identities. In short, context matters, and universities are uniquely positioned to prevent and respond to the violence that is happening within their communities.\n\nBeyond the specific points outlined above, the Dear Colleague letter sends a pivotal message to all students: To survivors, you will be believed and we will take your experience seriously; to perpetrators, you will be held accountable for your actions and we will sanction those who fail to adhere to our community's expectations for healthy and consensual behavior; to all members of the campus community, we are committed to creating safe educational opportunities for all.\n\nIt is imperative that the provisions outlined in the Dear Colleague letter remain in place. Survivors across the country are counting on the Department of Education to center their rights and needs. Everyone deserves to have access to a safe education, and to the related supports and resources.\n\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Wilmerding, MSW\nelizabeth.wilmerding@gmail.com\n443-844-0145\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Elizabeth Wilmerding","doc.state":"CA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16012&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Eagle Forum of Alabama","doc.comment_body":"COMMENT FROM EAGLE FORUM OF ALABAMA IN SUPPORT OF RESCINDING \n34 CFR  99 AND RESTORING THE CORRESPONDING REGULATION THAT EXISTED BEFORE 2012\n\nSince FERPA was passed in 1974 technology has rapidly advanced but the privacy protections at the federal level have remained antiquated in public education. Instead of increasing protections to meet the latest demands in technology and data collection techniques the U. S. Department of Education (USED) reduced protections under the Obama administration. When the USED under the Obama administration implemented a new regulation (34 CFR  99) under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC  1232g, in January 2012, the USED it essentially eliminated important privacy protections for millions of Americans. This meant millions of Americans, primarily students in their earliest years of learning would be made more vulnerable to privacy violations and targeted for harm.  Eagle Forum of Alabama urges USED to withdraw that regulation in its entirety. It is important to revert to the previous regulation and guidance issued, then either the statute or the regulations, or preferably both, can be rewritten to address pressing issues of student data-privacy today. \n\nThe regulation in question severely weakened the statute in major ways:\nIt abandoned the settled, longstanding interpretation of the term \"authorized representative\" (34 CFR  99.3). FERPA prohibits nonconsensual disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) except in several limited circumstances, one of which allows disclosure to \"authorized representatives\" of certain education institutions and individuals. Since at least 2003, USED had allowed such disclosure only to \"authorized representatives\" that are under the direct control of the disclosing entity (i.e., either an employee or a contractor). The 2012 regulation eliminated the \"direct control\" requirement, allowing instead the disclosing entity to designate \"any entity or individual\" as an authorized representative for purposes of receiving PII. This has led to a \"data free-for-all\" in which \"nongovernmental entities, including non-profits, religious organizations, foundations, independent researchers, and for-profit companies, as well as individuals, could be granted access to [PII] without notice or consent.\" \n\nIt created a broad definition of \"education program\" that includes programs not administered by an education agency under FERPA (34 CFR  99.3). This means that government officials can be given nonconsensual access to students' PII from any private program that receives any federal or state aid (such as preschool, recreation, special education, or job-training programs). This expansion provides \"virtually unlimited access to education records in the name of evaluating program outcomes to any pro-gram evaluators that can convince an authorized representative that they are reviewing an education pro-gram, as loosely defined [in the regulation].\" \n\nTo assist \"research studies,\" it allowed nonconsensual redisclosure of PII that was provided by cer-tain educational agencies and institutions to other such agencies and institutions pursuant to FERPA requirements (34 CFR  99.31(a)(6). For example, a state department of education would be allowed to grant researchers access to PII that the DOE received from a local school district for other purposes, without the knowledge or consent of that local district or the students\/families whose data is being passed along. USED has no legal authority to allow such redisclosure - and the \"implied disclosure\" enshrined by the regulation is a lawless usurpation of statutory authority.\n\nIt removed the requirement (previously contained in 34 CFR 99.35(a)(2)) that in order for a state or local educational authority to conduct an audit, evaluation, or compliance or enforcement activi-ty, it must demonstrate authority to do so under some federal, state, or local grant of authority (be-cause FERPA itself does not confer such authority) (34 CFR  99.35(a)(1),(2). Instead, the SEA or LEA can simply cite \"audit or evaluation\" as justification for disclosing PII, even if there is no statutory authority for the SEA\/LEA's action. This change \"turns another narrow consent exception into a magic incantation by which entities with no legal authority and no intention of actually conducting audits or studies can circumvent congressional intent, violate the privacy rights of students and families, and obtain unfettered access to [PII].\" \n\nFERPA must be revised to address such threats. In the meantime, USED can at least withdraw the January 2012 regulation and restore the protections that existed before the Obama administration eliminated them. Eagle Forum of Alabama urges USED to act swiftly to restore these protections for students in America. \n\n","doc.country":"Deborah Love","doc.name":"Deborah Love","doc.state":"Child advocate","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-16006&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Institution of Higher Education","doc.comment_body":"Please accept these comments regarding the evaluation of existing regulations.

At High Point, they experienced the best care and educational opportunities available in a loving and supportive community. I have no regrets, but I know the pressure has been on school systems for many years to eliminate schools like High Point in the name of an erroneous and misplaced desire for all students to be included. \n\nThe following is an article I wrote for The DD News Blog in celebration of my son Dannys 40th birthday.

Based in New York City, we focus our services on young people ages 24 and under, and we provide training to youth-serving professionals and other adults.\n \nMany Students are also Dating\/Sexual Violence Survivors \nAs an organization that works with young victims of dating violence, stalking and sexual violence, many of our clients are students. We believe that all students deserve a great education and to feel safe and welcomed in their classrooms.  Student survivors should not have to choose between their right to an education and their right to be safe. When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n \nAll Students deserve a right to an education free from discrimination \nOur education system has a long and troubled history of being unfair to too many students and communities. Title IX and other anti-discrimination laws protect students who identify as young women,  LGBTQ, Black, Latinx, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, or students with disabilities. These students regularly face too many barriers to educational success. We believe the guidance issued by the Obama administration provides an essential baseline of protection that should not be diminished. We oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that safeguard the civil rights of victims, students and others on the basis of gender, sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, or national origin.\n \nWe oppose the rescission of the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter (\"DCL\") that clarified schools' responsibilities to prevent and respond to gender-based violence under Title IX. \nThe 2011 DCL outlined steps that schools must take not only to protect survivors of gender-based violence, but also to protect the rights of the accused.\n \nThe Preponderance of the Evidence Standard adequately protects due process rights of all parties in the investigation of harassment and sexual violence. We take due process rights very seriously. We believe that due process is critical to seeking justice for our clients, many of whom are young people of color, queer identifying, with differing immigration statuses.  We support the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter precisely because it ensured that all students, both victims and those accused, would have access to due process. The DCL affirmed students rights to a fair and just system by outlining steps that schools should take to respond to gender-based violence while ensuring due process such as: \n- Hiring a Title IX coordinator;\n- Implementing and distributing the grievance procedures for filing complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination;\n- Providing \"adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints, including the opportunity for both parties to present \n  witnesses and other evidence;\"\n- Allowing both parties timely and equitable access to any information that will be used at a hearing; \n- Allowing both parties equal access to legal representation;\n- Allowing both parties access to appeal any final decision;\n- Requiring University staff involved in these proceedings to have training, and experience in handling complaints for sexual \n  harassment and sexual violence.\n \nThe Department of Education is entrusted with the important goal of providing high-quality education to all students. We  believe that rolling back protections for students experiencing discrimination harms not only those students, but our nation as a whole.\n","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Day One Anonymous","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15883&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"National Advocacy Organization","doc.city":"Washington","doc.comment_body":"These 60 constituents representing Louisiana join with the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in urging the U.S. Department of Education to protect Title IX, preserve all of its current regulations and guidance, and fully enforce the law. \n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.

RSA FAQs. Re: the definition of \"competitive integrated employment. USDOE to direct RSA to rescind the FAQs and place primacy on the actual language contained in the federal WIOA statute as it relates to whether a job meets the definition of competitive-integrated employment. Duly promulgated statute and regulation places authority with the vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselor to make a professional judgment about whether a job meets the definition of competitive-integrated employment, especially as it relates to the question of \"integrated\". The FAQs, on the other hand, include limitations that go beyond the statutory and regulatory definition of competitive-integrated employment. The VR counselor (many [or all] of whom in Pennsylvania hold a Master's Degree in Rehabilitation Counseling) is in the best position to make the judgment - on an individualized basis - and should not exclude employers or groups of employers based simply on an FAQ document that was not duly promulgated as a regulation or passed by Congress as a statute. Employment opportunities that pay minimum wage or higher and meet the integration test contemplated by Congress are being excluded merely due to the whim of federal bureaucrats. \n2. Section 511 Interpretation. RCPA encourages the USDOE to direct RSA to issue guidance to Designated State Units (DSUs) for vocational rehabilitation to treat adults with intellectual disabilities of any age the same as any other vocational rehabilitation customer by closing their case and\/or making an ineligibility determination when the individual, after being referred to the DSU and receiving information about what it has to offer, makes an informed decision to not accept additional vocational rehabilitation services. Adult men and women with intellectual disabilities must be given the dignity and respect of having their decisions about their own life honored. \n3. DSU data collection requirements. RCPA supports requirements for DSUs to collect relevant data on outcomes and services provided, but we are concerned that there are too many new data collection requirements imposed on DSUs that they are having to place excessive amounts of time, energy, and funding on data collection and reporting rather than emphasizing customer services and outcomes. \n4.Pre-Employment Transition Services (P.E.T.S.).  \na. Group Counseling. RSA's policy of making DSUs exclude any student who does not have a documented disability from group P.E.T.S. counseling is unnecessary, backward, and excessive. First, it is reminiscent of segregated training for students with disabilities. Second, WIOA requires DSUs to provide P.E.T.S. to students who are \"potentially eligible.\" Yet, RSA is requiring DSUs to exclude any student from group counseling without a documented disability, and furthermore it is requiring DSUs to document names of participants in the training and secure parental permission before participating. These limitations and requirements place a chilling effect on student engagement and denies students valuable information about a service that could help them get or keep a job. \nb. Transportation.  RSA policy has led to DSUs believing they are not allowed to permit students from utilizing transportation as a form of work readiness training, as part of a job exploration plan, or as a way to develop self-advocacy skills. Transportation is foundational to getting and keeping a job, yet RSA rules say no. This must be reversed. The US Department of Education should direct RSA to become more creative and find ways to say \"yes\" to needed services rather than always find a way to say \"no.\"\nc. Assistive Technology (AT).  RSA's prohibition on AT is similarly backward and unfortunate relative to its transportation policy. AT gives students with disabilities opportunities to pursue job exploration, develop job-readiness skills, and succeed during work-based learning experiences. RSA should encourage DSUs to find innovative ways to incorporate AT into P.E.T.S., not prohibit it.  \n5. The USDOE should direct its OSERS to require, as a condition of accepting federal IDEA funding, state education agencies to find a way that would allow a parental consent document to be applicable for both education and vocational rehabilitation services at the state and local level for students with disabilities. LEAs believe they are prohibited by law to share student information with vocational rehabilitation offices (under the jurisdiction of the DSU) without a separately signed release from the parent, yet this duplicative system does little else but cause frustration and administrative burden.  At the very least, the OSERS should develop a model agreement that state education agencies and DSUs could consider signing that would allow information about students with disabilities to be shared between LEAs and local vocational rehabilitation offices in a timely, protected, and confidential manner without risking a violation of law.\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Stephen Suroviec","doc.state":"PA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15837&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Academic\/Think Tank","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Nora Gordon","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15831&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"National Advocacy Organization","doc.comment_body":"See attached comments submitted by the National Center for Lesbian Rights.","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Julianna Gonen","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15828&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Data Quality Campaign","doc.comment_body":"Attached, please find comments from the Data Quality Campaign and partners.","doc.country":"Rachel Anderson","doc.name":"Rachel Anderson","doc.state":"National Advocacy Organization","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15826&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Association\/Organization","doc.city":"United States","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)\n\nThe Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS) works to make higher education more available and affordable for people of all backgrounds. Through nonpartisan research, analysis, and advocacy, we aim to improve the processes and policies that can pave the way to successful educational outcomes for students and for society. These comments are in response to the June 22, 2017 Federal Register notice regarding the U.S. Department of Education's request for input on implementing Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda\", which calls for a review of current federal regulations.\n\nAny higher education regulatory review must prioritize the needs of students and taxpayers - those the regulations are designed to protect - over the interests of regulated entities that will naturally desire less oversight. We and others have long been troubled that the recommendations of the Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education represented the views of just 16 colleges, and excluded student and taxpayer representation entirely. As a result, the report's recommendations in no way represent a consensus opinion among colleges or other higher education stakeholders. The report's recommendations for changing the negotiated rulemaking process, for example, would increase the influence of professional lobbyists over practitioners, a change we and many others strongly oppose. We are concerned that, as part of this regulatory review process, the Department plans to meet with college presidents and financial aid officers, but has not announced similar meetings with students, consumers, and those who advocate on their behalf.\n\nWe strongly believe that current federal higher education regulations and oversight need to be strengthened and improved to better protect students and taxpayers. This requires not only identifying ways to reduce unnecessary burdens on colleges that are clearly serving students well, but also requires increasing scrutiny and oversight of schools that pose greater risks to students and taxpayers. Precedent exists for providing colleges with greater flexibility based on positive track records. For example, under current law, schools with lower default rates are given greater flexibility in the disbursement of student loans.  In addition, nonprofit and for-profit colleges with strong financial responsibility scores are subject to less oversight and monitoring than schools with lower financial responsibility scores.  However, these examples are exceptions to the general one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and oversight, which tends to overregulate the best colleges and under-regulate the worst. Smarter, more targeted oversight requires grounding regulations in performance and taking into account the actual risks that a school poses to students and taxpayers.\n\nImportantly, many of the Department of Education regulations that schools find most burdensome are required by legislation, and reducing their regulatory burden will require working with Congress to make statutory changes.  As the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) stated in its public comments, many of the regulations most consistently mentioned as concerns by its member institutions cannot be addressed without a change in statute.  \n\nFor example, since July 1, 2013, borrowers have faced a limit on the length of time they can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. This 150% Direct Subsidized Loan Limit, or SULA, is notoriously complicated for both borrowers and schools to navigate. The resulting regulatory burden could be greatly reduced by either eliminating the time limit completely or changing it to the full-time equivalent of six years, but both solutions would require a change in the law.  Other examples of statutorily-driven regulations that are needlessly onerous or restrictive for colleges and\/or students include: the inclusion of at least 20 overly burdensome financial questions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) that do not have a significant impact on financial aid determination and could be eliminated; overly prescriptive statutory provisions governing the content of online federal student loan counseling tools, which have led to text-heavy and excessively technical content that impedes the counseling's effectiveness; and the federal ban on creating a student level data network, the implementation of which would, along with providing other benefits for students, states and policymakers, reduce the burden schools currently face in complying with federal reporting requirements. \n\nWe urge the Department of Education to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to address these and other burdensome provisions with an eye towards protecting students and taxpayers and reducing unnecessary burdens on colleges that serve students well.  \n\nThank you, and If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at dcochrane@ticas.org or 510-318-7900.

Amend 29 U.S.C. Section 730(d)(1) of WIOA to exclude students' transportation or travel costs from administrative costs. And, amend the definition of administrative costs in 34 C.F.R.  361.5(c)(2) to exclude students' transportation and travel costs for customers.\nSpecifically, modify guidance to allow States to pay for technology needed for students' education, skill development, and participation in Pre-ETS under \"authorized activities,\" as defined in under 34 C.F.R.  361.48(a)(3)(i) and 34 C.F.R.  361.48(a)(3)(ii).\nSpecifically, modify guidance to include coaching supports when necessary to support work-based learning experiences.\nOverall, the regulations on Pre-ETS should give states considerably more flexibility in determining a broader range of services that could potentially enhance a student's career development. The lack of flexibility inhibits the SVRAs' capacity to fully engage students in the required Pre-ETS on a scale necessary to expend the full amount of the Pre-ETS reserved funds.  This may potentially limit the success of the Pre-ETS implementation.\n\nRecommendations:  Amend 34 C.F.R.  397 to allow individuals of any age to make informed choice for subminimum wage employment and to opt out of the follow-up and follow-along services.   Allowing individuals to opt out of such services would not only honor their choice, but would allow VR agencies and staff to expend the resources on services that individuals with disabilities are choosing to receive to seek and maintain employment.\n\nRecommendation:  RSA amend the following data elements in the most recent RSA-911 case services reporting manual as follows:\n1.The extent, detail and frequency of the new data elements and collection are time-consuming and can possibly limit the time that SVRA staff engage with participants. It potentially inhibits establishing the counseling relationship necessary for engaging in the VR process.\n2.Strike or reduce Section XVIII:  Eliminate or simplify the Post-Exit Data Elements from the RSA-911 reporting requirements.\n3.Allow all individuals to choose not to self-identify their race and strike instructions mandating staff to identify race.\n4.Reassess and potentially remove data elements 64, 67, 69, 70, and 71.\n\nSee attached file for more information,\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comment.\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Frank Coco","doc.state":"NY","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15763&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"United States","doc.comment_body":"Please see attached letter submitted on behalf of the Institute for Higher Education Policy.","doc.country":"Institute for Higher Education Policy","doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":"Association\/Organization","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15759&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"United States","doc.comment_body":"Please see attached letter submitted on behalf of 24 members and partners of the Postsecondary Data Collaborative.","doc.country":"Postsecondary Data Collaborative","doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":"Other","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15758&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Lambda Legal","doc.city":"Washington","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Sasha Buchert","doc.state":"DC","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15757&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"State Agency (Other)","doc.city":"Harrisburg","doc.comment_body":"See attached file titled - RSA Deregulation Recommendations - PA OVR (9-20-17) for Docket ID (ED-2017-OS-0074-0001) \n\nRespectfully submitted by\nDavid DeNotaris, PA OVR Executive Director\nddenotaris@pa.gov\n\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"David DeNotaris","doc.state":"PA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15752&attachmentNumber=2&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Thomas Beckett","doc.city":"United States","doc.comment_body":"American Public Education, Inc.

SEAs, especially smaller ones, can partner with Nonprofits and CSOs to more effectively and more efficiently manage these types of awards.\n\nSecond, the facility aid is prescribed to be a per-pupil funding model. This was the most reasonable option when the program was created. Since then, states have come up with other creative facility aid programs that should be incentivized. These range from  providing the states' moral obligation to charter school financing to giving charter schools first right to acquire empty school buildings (or lease them for $1\/year). States may come up with other creative facility aid solutions that are outside of the original prescribed method. This approach would be consistent with the Department's shift toward giving states more autonomy in defining how they can provide solutions to some of the intractable problems in education. \n\nBoth of these shifts can be accomplished with minor word changes to the program description in the Federal Register.

We write to urge the Department of Education to recognize the existing Title IX guidance and the DCL as necessary tools in our country's efforts to end sexual violence and protect the rights of all students.\n\nSexual violence is an epidemic at our institutions of higher education.  According to the Bureau of Justice, 21% of female students and 7% of male students will experience sexual assault during college. Title IX and its associated guidance play a vital role in ensuring that all college students can safely access everything their schools have to offer. MCASA is certain that the Department will conclude that vigorous enforcement of Title IX and associated guidance is the best way forward. \n\nRecently, Secretary DeVoshas stated that the policies currentlyin place are unfair and harmful to survivors, the accused, and administrators, but existing Title IX guidance already has ample protections in place to ensure fairness to all parties involved in a sexual misconduct investigation.  In fact, current Title IX guidance affords even more due process than the Constitution does to all students (both those accused of misconduct and those seeking protection).  If schools are failing to ensure fairness to all parties, the solution is to rigorously enforce Title IXregulations, not to undermine them.\n\nIt is also vitally important that Title IX guidance continues to support the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard in college investigations.  The preponderance of the evidence is the standard generally used in civil cases, and is the standard used in other civil rights discrimination cases; to hold victims of sexual violence to a different standard would be discriminatory in itself.  The preponderance standard also equally values the education of both parties involved in a sexual misconduct investigation, which goes to the very heart of Title IX's purpose.  Imposing a higher standard of evidence and rolling back Title IX protections would tip the scales against survivors and would discourage them from coming forward.\n\nMCASA's Sexual Assault Legal Institute (SALI) is a legal services program in Maryland that regularly aids student survivors of sexual violence.  Our clients depend on Title IX and its existing guidance to help them access their education in the aftermath of a sexual assault.  One client, \"Chloe,\" was being repeatedly harassed over the course of an evening by \"Mark,\" who she had seen around, but had not hung out with before.  Eventually, she went back to her dorm to get away from him, but he followed her into her room.  Mark repeatedly asked Chloe to have sex with him, and she repeatedly refused.  Mark persisted, and eventually used a combination of coercion and physical pressure on Chloe's head to force her to fellate him.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Chloe worked up the courage to report what had happened to her school. Chloe's school provided her with safety accommodations that she requested, including moving Mark to a different dorm and issuing a no contact order.  Chloe's case caused the school to rethink its definition of sexual misconduct. The following school year, Chloe's school added sexual coercion to its sexual misconduct policy. The school also made changes to how investigations at the school are conducted as a result of investigator bias problems that arose in Chloe's case. Now, students who report sexual misconduct at Chloe's school have more reassurance that investigations will be conducted fairly and impartially, and the school has the ability to find perpetrators responsible for sexual misconduct when they use coercive tactics.\n\nBecause of Title IX, Chloe was able to get the accommodations and support she needed to continue her studies during her school's investigation, and her school improved its sexual misconduct policies, which it may not have done had robust Title IX guidance and enforcement not been in place.  We cannot allow students like Chloe to suffer further after an assault because their colleges or their government refuse to rigorously enforce their rights.  The 2011 DCL and other Title IX guidance are essential to ensuring we do not fail our student survivors of sexual assault.  MCASA urges the Department of Education to continue to enforce Title IX as it currently stands, and to focus its energy on supporting schools as they attempt to author and implement sexual misconduct policies that meet the full requirements of the law.  \n\nWe appreciate your consideration of our comments.

Jordan, Esq., Executive Director and Counsel (lcjordan@mcasa.org).\n\nSincerely, \n\nMaryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MCASA)\nMCASA's Sexual Assault Legal Institute\n","doc.country":"Lisae C.

With our assistance, over 200 individuals are earning paychecks and paying taxes.  The regulations for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act are threatening the success of the individuals we serve to find employment. \nRehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) within DOE has expanded the regulations beyond the original Statute passed by Congress.  \n\n1. There is dignity in work. Americans with disabilities must be able to choose where they work and what work they want to do - just like Americans without disabilities. This is a basic human right! \n\n2. It is difficult to imagine but this will limit job opportunities and choice for Americans with disabilities when the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities already hovers around 70-75% year after year.\n\n3. The Department (DOE) and RSA specifically, should focus on expanding employment choice for people with disabilities, not further limiting it. People with disabilities want and deserve a full array of options. A definition that limits their menu of choices will not lead to further integration, but rather will reduce opportunities and cost people with disabilities jobs. \n \n4. The definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)) was rewritten and re-defined during the regulatory process. The Department of Education changed what Congress intended by narrowing and limiting what qualifies as \"competitive integrated employment\". This narrow definition should be eliminated and replaced with the definition in the WIOA statute until a broader, more expansive definition that does not eliminate job opportunities and choice can be put in its place. \n\n5. In both the definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (CIE) and the definition of \"integrated setting\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(32)), the Department describes integration occurring at the \"work unit\" level. This language is not found in the WIOA statute. It was added by RSA in the regulatory process. Defining integration as occurring at the \"work unit\" level is job limiting and so subjective that it would be impossible to apply to the general workforce given that people with disabilities have every right to their privacy. It only targets people who work through providers of services to people with disabilities, which is inherently unfair and treats people with disabilities differently from the workforce at large. Moreover, as a simple matter of math, requiring a two-person crew currently employing two people with disabilities to be fully integrated would mean one person on the crew would have to be without disabilities. The narrow interpretations of \"Community Integrated Employment (CIE)\" and integrated settings have ultimately diminished work opportunities for people with disabilities. \n\nThe following language must be deleted. Specifically, excerpts that overreach on defining the \"typically found in the community\" component of \"competitive integrated employment (CIE)\" and discriminate against not-for-profit employers (community rehabilitation programs) that provide services and jobs to individuals with disabilities. DOE should eliminate the following guidance sections published in the Federal Register: \n\nFederal Register\/Vol. 81, No. 161\/Friday, August 19, 2016\/Rules and Regulations. Page 55643: \n\"As explained earlier, businesses established by community rehabilitation programs or any other entity for the primary purpose of employing individuals with disabilities do not satisfy this criterion and, are therefore, not considered integrated settings, because these are not within the competitive labor market\". \n\nThe factors that generally would result in a business being considered \"not typically found in the community,\" include: (1) The funding of positions through Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD): (1) The funding of positions through Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD) contracts; (2) allowances under the FLSA for compensatory subminimum wages; and (3) compliance with a mandated direct labor - hour ratio of persons with disabilities\"\n\nPlease see attached for additional comments on the impact of these regulations on youth and those under 25 years of age.

with disabilities who might not be able to access these long-overdue services because of Draconian cuts to Medicaid, to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and other health care programs that provide health care to students and other young adults with disabilities.\n\nWhile we fully appreciate that the U.S. Department of Education does not have jurisdiction over the U.S. Congress' legislation, we feel very strongly that drastic cuts to Medicaid, CHIP, and other health care programs which serve students and other young adults with disabilities should be taken into account should the number of students and young adults with disabilities accessing these important services not be fully realized.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this important issue.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS FOR QUALIFIED REHABILITATION COUNSELORS\n\nToday, in America, we are experiencing an alarming increase in insufficient training of Americans across the employment spectrum.\n\nQualified Rehabilitation Counselors, in both the public and private sectors, possess the specialized skills set to provide the individualized services and supports to all eligible individuals with disabilities, including those with multiple, significant disabilities.\n\nThese specialized skills set include: counseling and guidance; knowledge and appreciation of the medical and psychological aspects of disability, knowledge and implementation of vocational assessment strategies and application of transferable skills; working knowledge and integration of labor market data pertaining to individuals with disabilities; skills and abilities to match business workforce needs with the client's skills and talents; and providing services required to develop and implement the individualized career plan that enables the individual to successfully be employed.\n\nWe respectfully request that the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) in the U.S. Department of Education clarify the language in Title IV of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to reflect language that the inclusion of a business degree does not supplant the Master's Degree in Rehabilitation Counseling nor the highest standard in the State, but is merely supplemental to the list of degrees referenced in the Rehabilitation Act, as amended.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this request......\n\nPlease see attached document for rest of comment.

Trauma occurs to a child,\n2. Brain development of child is interrupted,\n3. The affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes negatively impacted show up in the classroom impeding learning,\n4. A teacher ill-equipped with the knowledge and symptomatology of trauma makes a referral for special needs testing,\n5. A misdiagnosis of a learning disability follows,\n6. Wrong accommodations and treatments are applied,\n7. Trauma is exacerbated increasing the vulnerability of the child for comorbidity\n8. Mental health issues begin to make themselves evident, and eventually,\n9.

Through a collective voice, WCADVSA is committed to provide leadership, education and systems advocacy to advance social change and end violence. Because these crimes impact young people during their college years, responding to Campus Sexual Assault is a priority in Wyoming, from the University of Wyoming to all the community colleges, several of which are under investigation at this moment for violating Title IX and the Cleary Act.\n\nWCADVSA echoes the statement attached from National Alliance to End Sexual Violence (NAESV), the national voice for state and local programs working to support survivors and end sexual violence. Sexual assault is widespread and devastating to survivors on campus and in K-12 education settings. Victim\/survivors can experience serious, discriminatory harms, and the issuance of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) 2011 Dear Colleague letter was compelled by the acute needs of students. The letter's clarifications of OCR's previous regulatory guidance and enforcement actions are fully consistent with the civil rights approach to discriminatory harassment and the rules in the vast majority of other civil proceedings. Indeed, if OCR had adopted a different approach, it would have engaged in a dangerous kind of exceptionalism for only sexual violence and its victim\/survivors, the majority of whom are women and girls. WCADVSA supports the correct clarification that the evidentiary standard in campus disciplinary hearings is preponderance of the evidence and does not impact due process protections for students involved in a university's sexual misconduct process. Any due process issues are usually due to the individual university policies or a misinterpretation of the guidance, no the guidance itself.\n\nTitle IX protects the entire campus community across gender identities and ensures that schools are equipped to both prevent and remedy gender-based discrimination. The withdrawn OCR 2016 guidance clarifies and reinforces this message, requiring schools to treat students in ways that are consistent with their gender identities. Any harassment of a student based on their gender identity or denial of educational programming or activities based on that gender identity is discriminatory and harmful and must be remedied. WCADVSA supports the 2016 guidance and the rights of transgender students to have access to a safe, nondiscriminatory environment where they learn, live, socialize, and compete as athletes. It is well-known that transgender students are at greater risk for being sexually victimized and harassed than their cisgender counterparts whether in a restroom or walking to class. All students have the right to an education free from sexual harassment and violence. \n\nOn behalf of survivors and local programs serving survivors and providing prevention education in their communities, WCADVSA urges the U.S. Department of Education to:\n\n1) keep the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter in place as extraordinarily helpful and clarifying guidance articulating necessary, legally correct, and historically-followed standards that help both students and schools; and\n\n2) reinstate the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students to remedy this dangerous step backwards as a nation, leaving students who identify as transgender at risk for violence, interrupted education, and a myriad of potential harmful consequences. \n\nHave additional questions?

I am writing in response to the ED request for public comment on regulations for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda.\" Any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and\/or other administrative activity must advance educational equity and serve the interests of all students. I believe ED's narrow slant and sole focus with this regulatory review skews too far toward reducing burden on \"entities significantly affected by Federal regulations\" with a dangerous disregard for students.\nI strongly endorse the following COPAA recommendations:\n1)Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws: The Civil Rights Act of 1964; ESEA\/ESSA; Education Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX); The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504); IDEA; HEA; ADA; WIOA; PERKINS; FOIA; and FERPA. \nAs this relates to IDEA in particular: \"The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation.\" I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\n2)Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n3)Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n4)Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parent's right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\nThe letters to rescind are:\nParent's right to include\/invite participants to IEP meetings: Letter to Anonymous (2003); Letter to Byrd (2003) These letters must be rescinded. IDEA, 20 U.S.C.  1414(d)(1)(B)(vi) and the regulations, 30 C.F.R.  300.321(a)(6) and (c)allows parents and school district-at their discretion-to include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent's right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings. \nParent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom: Letter to Mamas (2004) This letter must be rescinded. As stated above, Congress has repeatedly found that \"the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by ... strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home.\" 601(C)(5). To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with\/support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom. To fully participate as members of the IEP team, they should have the right to observe the child's education in progress, a proposed placement, whether accommodations and services are being provided, and other matters. \nIndependent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator. Letter to LaDolce (2007); This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C.F.R. 300.503(c) requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations (IEE). While the agency [state\/district] may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation (34 C.F.R 300.502(a)(2)), the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the child's IEP. \nFailure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504. Letter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996):  This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they \"would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements.\" This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to comment.\n\nJennie H.

It is our understanding that the USED is looking for input into which federal regulations should be retained or revised as potential over-reaches of federal administrative overreach.  Providing special education and related services to students with disabilities should never be viewed as a burden for public schools.  All students, including students with disabilities, should be held to high expectations and have equitable access to educational opportunities that enrich their lives and prepare them for future success.  We should never forget the Congressional findings and purpose when passing P.L. 94-142: (1) there are more than eight million children with disabilities in the United States today; (2) the special educational needs of such children are not being fully met; (3) more than half of the children with disabilities in the United States do not receive appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity; (4) one million of the children with disabilities in the United States are excluded entirely from the public school system and will not go through the educational process with their peers; (5) there are many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose disabilities prevent them from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities are undetected; (6) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families are often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense; (7) developments in the training of teachers and in diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods have advanced to the point that, given appropriate funding, State and local educational agencies can and will provide effective special education and related services to meet the needs of children with  disabilities; (8) State and local educational agencies have a responsibility to provide education for all children with disabilities, but present financial resources are inadequate to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities; and (9) it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities in order to assure equal protection of the law.\n\nIt was the purpose of P.L. 94-142 to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.\n\nToday, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), all children with disabilities have the right to be enrolled in and attend school, and to receive a free appropriate public education.  But this right must be carefully guarded and the rights and protections afforded to students with disabilities and their parents under the IDEA must not be eroded.  The regulations at 34 CFR Part 300 implement the statutory requirements of the IDEA and should be retained.\n\nIn particular we wish to emphasize that the state complaint procedures (34 CFR 300.151 through 300.153) should be retained.  While some comments in 2006 suggested that the state complaint procedures should be limited, this procedure gives parents an easy and quick means to resolve disputes with schools and to address procedural violations.  Without the broad coverage that the state complaint process affords, many parents will effectively be left without a remedy as they will be unable to navigate the due process procedures which are much more complicated and typically involve attorneys on both sides.  The complexity and cost of due process hearings makes that process out of reach of many.\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Dana Long","doc.state":"IN","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15397&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Teacher","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Johan Fremlin","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15396&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"School Administrator","doc.city":"Waukesha","doc.comment_body":"Please see attached.","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Joseph Koch","doc.state":"WI","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15391&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Individual","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Steven Walker","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15380&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Community Organization","doc.comment_body":"September 20, 2017\n\nHilary Malawer, Esq.\nAssistant General Counsel\nOffice of the General Counsel\nUnited States Department of Education\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW Room 6E231\nWashington, DC 20202\n\nRE: Docket ID is ED-2017-OS-0074-0001.\n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\nI have worked in the field of disability employment for nearly forty years. Throughout that time, I have had the pleasure of working with our state rehabilitation agency as a provider and with our county service delivery areas as a member of the Private Industry Council and Workforce Investment Board to advocate for community employment for people with disabilities. I have witnessed the benefits of integrating services for people with disabilities through the One Stop Service Center. I fear that those benefits will disintegrate with the definitions included in 34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)) and Section 511 of WIOA.\n\nI am significantly concerned with the definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)) that was rewritten during the regulatory process.  The Department of Education narrowed what qualifies as competitive integrated employment. This was not the intent of Congress.  The definition should be eliminated and replaced with the definition in the WIOA statute until a broader, more expansive definition can be put in its place. Defining integration as it is, clearly targets people who work through providers of services such as me. I feel this is unfair to people with disabilities and treats them differently from the workforce at large. The narrow interpretation of integrated settings will effectively reduce work opportunities for people with disabilities. \n\nThe Department's focus should be on expanding employment choice for people with disabilities, not limiting it.  People with disabilities want and deserve a full array of options.  According to Department of Education and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) jobs falling under programs intended to employ people with disabilities would not qualify as an employment outcome under the law.  This represents a significant change of federal policy and turns the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act and WIOA on its head.  People with disabilities who want to work should be helped in every way possible to find and keep work.  \n\nThere is dignity in work and, all people with disabilities regardless of age should be permitted to work as soon as they complete their education.  Section 511 of WIOA currently prevents people with disabilities under the age of 25 from working under 14(c) certificates even if that is their informed choice to do so.  For many, a 14(c) certificate work opportunity may be the primary option for paid employment.  It does not benefit a person who wants to work to be placed in a day program or left at home.

Regulations and Guidance (in subtitles A and B of title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations)\n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\nLegal Aid at Work (formerly Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center) submits the following comments on the Department of Education's Request for Comments on Existing Department of Education Regulations and Guidance (in subtitles A and B of title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\")). \n\nLegal Aid at Work is a 100 year old nonprofit providing free legal services across California and in other states to low-income individuals and their families who face unlawful discrimination and other injustices. We advance equality and access in the workplace, schools, and other community and public facilities, including through enforcement of Title IX. Fair Play for Girls in Sports, a project of Legal Aid at Work, has been dedicated for nearly 15 years to expanding the possibilities for girls and young women by enforcing Title IX in educational environments, specifically as to athletic programming. \n\nWe daily work on matters to enforce Title IX's promise of equity, in particular focusing on girls in public schools in grades K-12 to ensure gender equality in education, specifically in schools' athletic programming. Girls who participate in sports experience better academic, health, and employment outcomes. Through the experience of our work and that of enforcing Title IX across the country alongside many other advocates we have seen Title IX's profound impact on girls' and women's athletic participation. Millions more female students are now able to participate in sports, and on a more \"equal playing field,\" than before the law's passagethe supporting regulations and guidance have been critical in achieving such progress.  \n\nWithin the Fair Play project we regularly rely and focus on the regulations pertaining to athletic equality, in particular Subtitle BRegulations of the Offices of the Department of Education, Chapter IOffice for Civil Rights, Department of Education. Within Subtitle B, the regulations 106.1 to 106.71 are of key importance to enforcing Title IX to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. Not only do educational institutions, students, and staff rely on the clear guidance of the regulations, many courts do as well. See e.g. Mansourian v. Regents of Univ. of California, 602 F.3d 957, 964 (9th Cir. 2010). We strongly recommend that the Department maintain the regulations and related guidance governing schools to ensure such educational institutions are gender equitable. \n\nIn addition the aforementioned regulations, the Dear Colleague letters, 1979 Policy Interpretation, and the OCR Investigators' Manual pertaining to athletics are central to enforcement of Title IX. For example, the Policy Interpretation has been cited by 100 federal courts throughout the country. See e.g., Ollier v. Sweetwater Union High Sch. Dist., 768 F.3d 843, 854 (9th Cir. 2014). Similarly, dozens of courts rely on the Investigator's Manual to appropriately navigate and apply Title IX's standards. See e.g., Cohen v. Brown Univ., 809 F. Supp. 978, 984 (D.R.I. 1992), aff'd, 991 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1993). And the Dear Colleague Letters relating to athletics, as well as clarifications and other letters as to sports offerings in the educational context provide further guidance to the courts and public as to how Title IX must be applied to provide gender equitable athletic programming to girls and women. See e.g., Biediger v. Quinnipiac Univ., 728 F. Supp. 2d 62, 92 (D. Conn. 2010), aff'd, 691 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2012).  \nThank you for taking into consideration our comments regarding the critical regulations and related materials promulgated by the Department of Education which serve as a lynchpin for ensuring schools, colleges, and universities adhere to Title IX's requirements. While unfortunately not all institutions are yet in compliance, the regulations and guidance are crucial to ongoing efforts to bring such institutions into the compliance foldto ensure girls and young women nationwide can learn and participate in educational-athletic activities critical to their lifelong wellbeing.  We would be more than happy to discuss our comments further and\/or answer any questions you may have. For additional information, please contact me at 415-864-8848.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKim Turner\nSenior Staff Attorney\nFair Play for Girls in Sports Project \/ Gender & LGBT Rights Program \nLegal Aid at Work \n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Kim Turner","doc.state":"Legal Aid at Work","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15315&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Access to Independence","doc.city":"Cortland","doc.comment_body":"Please see attached letter.\n\nThank you,\n\nChad W.

The department has an obligation to ensure that all students have equal educational opportunities, a mandate that applies regardless of a students gender identity. Transgender students who face discrimination in schools have worse educational outcomes, and poorer psychological well-being than their cisgender peers.\n\nThe guidance released by the Departments of Justice and Education last May clarified for school districts across the country that transgender students are protected under Title IX, an existing federal civil rights law that protects students from discrimination based on sex. The guidance presented best practices from schools across the country and advised schools on complying with the law. School districts received much-needed clarification that, under federal law, they must treat students equally and with dignity, consistent with their gender identity. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of transgender students received a clear message: the law was on their side.\nBy rescinding the guidance today, the Trump administration has taken the opposite stance. They have sent a deeply troubling message to students that the administration will not stand up for students civil rights. We condemn the administrations decision, vow to fight to enforce Title IX, which continues to protect transgender students, and call on individual schools and districts to treat students consistent with their gender identity and consistent with the rescinded guidance that accurately explained the law.\n\nThe Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights\nNational Center for Transgender Equality\nGLSEN\nNational Womens Law Center\nNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\nHuman Rights Campaign\nMALDEF\nAmerican Association for Access, Equity and Diversity\nAmerican Association of University Women (AAUW)\nAmerican Federation of Teachers\nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee\nThe American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State\nAnti-Defamation League\nAsian Pacific American Labor Alliance, AFL-CIO (APALA)\nAssociation of University Centers on Disabilities\nCenter for American Progress\nCenter for Law and Social Policy (CLASP)\nCenter for Reproductive Rights\nChildrens Defense Fund\nDisability Rights Education & Defense Fund\nEducation Law Center-PA\nEducators for Excellence\nFamily Equality Council\nFeminist Majority Foundation\nJudge David L.

Incidents of sexual assault on college campuses are alarmingly frequent - one in five women and one in sixteen men will be sexually assaulted in college, and over ninety percent of these students will not report the assault. (National Sexual Violence Resource Center - Statistics about Sexual Violence, 2015)\n\nIt is imperative the Department of Education provides protections to survivors under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Instead of stripping away Title IX implementation regulations, we urge the Department to work to support survivors of violence and provide additional resources to schools and colleges to combat the culture of violence. \n\nTitle IX requires schools that receive federal funding to provide equal access to educational programs and activities. Sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking create hostile educational environments that impede survivors ability to achieve their full potential in both educational and extracurricular settings. Removing the regulatory guidance runs counter to the intention of the law and will lead to a greater risk for survivors. Additionally, removal of the Title IX implementation guidance denies both survivors and accused perpetrators the rigorous adjudication process students deserve.\n\nJWI provides critically important proactive, prevention programming on college campuses, teaching students about sexual assault, dating abuse, and bystander intervention.  Through our multi-faceted holistic program, Change the Culture, we hear from scores of students who want more prevention education. A revocation of Title IX guidance will make it challenging to provide this information to students and create the cultural changes needed on campuses.  \n\nEvery student deserves equal protection under the law. Strong enforcement of Title II, VI and IX from the Department of Education is essential. JWI calls on the Department of Education to protect the civil rights of students and maintain all existing guidance and regulations\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Loribeth Weinstein","doc.state":"DC","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15278&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"State Agency (Other)","doc.comment_body":"The attached document contains comments from Minnesota Vocational Rehabilitation - General regarding Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"John Fisher","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15260&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Parent\/Relative","doc.city":"Grand Rapids","doc.comment_body":"\nPlease see attached comment.","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Amanda Rhines","doc.state":"MI","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-15259&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Governor's Advisory Council for Exceptional Citizens (GACEC)","doc.city":"Dover","doc.comment_body":" \n\nGovernors Advisory Council for Exceptional Citizens (GACEC)\n516 West Loockerman St., Dover, DE  19904\n302-739-4553 (voice)   302-739-6126 (fax)   http:\/\/www.gacec.delaware.gov\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDATE:September 19, 2017\n\nTO:Hilary Malawer\nAssistant General Counsel\nOffice of the General Counsel\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Avenue SW\n\nFROM:Dafne A.

We recently expanded our services to include extensive financial literacy training, life skills courses, job search tools and an expansive database of scholarships and grants under Champion Empowerment Institute.  The goals of both companies are to enrich lives through our training, mentoring and life-skills offerings, to build the self-esteem and self-worth of students, and to support long-term success and contentment.  \n\nDuring my career, spanning 30 years of working in education, I helped draft the original cohort default rate (CDR) laws and regulations including drafting Appendix D, the original criteria for default prevention plans, later versions for default prevention as seen in Subpart M and Subpart N, the appeals rights, disclosures, and several versions of the Cohort Default Rate Guide.  I have provided valuable information for lawmakers and regulators in all aspects of student loans, and have served as a special witness, alternate negotiator and twice as a lead negotiator for the Department's negotiated rulemaking processes in 1999, 2000, and 2009.\n\nI have also provided data analysis and evidence motived by my goal of ensuring ethical practices and quality servicing for students that support the right of all Americans to choose from a variety of quality educational options.  My drive comes from my own journey as an at-risk student, and my passion in business and life continues to be helping others overcome obstacles and attain success.\n\nIt is an honor and pleasure to be able to provide suggestions for regulatory changes that will continue to support the quality of education and student loan servicing in our country.\n\nI have included suggestions for the following regulatory changes:\n\n34 C.F.R 668.209(b)(2)(ii)  Mandates for Student Loan Payment Application (page 3)\n34 C.F.R 668.217  Mandates for Default Prevention Plans (page 5)\n34 C.F.R 668.202(c)(2) and New Regulations to be Developed  Default Statuses Processed in Error (page 7)\n34 C.F.R 668.212(b)  Expansion of Loan Servicing Appeals (page 9)\n34 C.F.R 668.23, 668.2 and 682.200  Mandates for Third-party Servicer Audits (page 13)\n\nPlease, don't hesitate to contact me if you need any additional clarification or back-up documentation either at ML@ChampionCollegeServices.com or (480) 947-7375.\n\nYour time and consideration is greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary Lyn Hammer\n\nMary Lyn Hammer\nEducation Advocate\nPresident and CEO\nChampion College Services\nChampion Empowerment Institute\nChampion for Success, a nonprofit corporation\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Mary Lyn Hammer","doc.state":"AZ","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14853&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"IDEA Infant Toddler Coordinators Association (ITCA)","doc.city":"Burke","doc.comment_body":"Attached is the statement from the IDEA Infant Toddler Coordinators Association (ITCA)\nSee attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Sharon Walsh","doc.state":"VA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14851&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Student","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14845&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Parent\/Relative","doc.city":"LaFayette","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Mary Wimbley","doc.state":"GA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14821&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"k(no)w","doc.city":"Wooster","doc.comment_body":"I am a survivor of sexual assault.

Details on language and reasoning for these regulatory changes are detailed in the attachment to comments. CALCASA is the technical assistance and training provider for 84 rape crisis centers in California, as well as the founding member of Raliance, a long time service provider and collaborator with campus programs throughout the United States, and a California and national voice for survivors of sexual assault. Just a few short years ago, Title IX was seriously under-utilized and under-enforced.  Survivors of sexual assault on and around campus were silenced, ignored, and chastised.  Sexual violence was an accepted social norm on many campuses.  Students and advocates organized to shine a light on this unacceptable state and many survivors came forward with similar stories of schools ignoring sexual harassment and sexual violence, or shared experiences of schools having largely inappropriate and useless processes for handling grievances. As a nation, we cannot go back to these dark ages of ignoring sexual harassment on campus and failing to create safe and healthy school systemsfrom Kindergarten to graduate school.  Now is the time to preserve valuable gains in how sexual harassment is taken seriously in schools throughout the nation.","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Emily Austin","doc.state":"California Coalition Against Sexual Assualt","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14312&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Education Corporation of America","doc.comment_body":"Please see attached comments.","doc.country":"Roger Swartzwelder","doc.name":"Roger Swartzwelder","doc.state":"Private\/For-Profit Institution of Higher Education","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14285&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Parent\/Relative","doc.city":"Davidsonville","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Sarah Davis","doc.state":"MD","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14244&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"National Association of Blind Merchants","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"National Advocacy Organization","doc.name":"Nicholas Gacos","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14241&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Parent\/Relative","doc.city":"Concord","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Kelly McCarthy","doc.state":"CA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14216&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"United States","doc.comment_body":"See attached file(s)","doc.country":"Parent\/Relative","doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14215&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Public elementary\/secondary school","doc.city":"monroe","doc.comment_body":"My Son is ADHD \/ Duplicate Chromosome 8 , If you guys take the help that many kids need they may not ever succeed in life. they need all the help they can get. i cant believe the gov would even consider taking that away from our youth.","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"April Reno","doc.state":"NC","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-14190&attachmentNumber=2&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc.(COPAA)","doc.city":"Concord","doc.comment_body":"I'm submitting comments in two major areas first:Evaluation of Existing Regulations and the second: including and correcting correcting misconceptions about the use of the terms dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia.  \n\n1.

I am writing in response to the U.S. Department of Educations (ED) request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration.\n\n \nI strongly believe that the test of any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and\/or other administrative activity must be whether it advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students. My concern is that the focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nations education laws  students. \n\nThe existing regulations, guidance, and technical assistance are all thoughtfully written in plain English and very helpful to me in supporting my child and school in doing our best to help children achieve post-secondary success. Therefore, I strongly believe in the following: \n\n1.Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\n\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws:\n\n \n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\n\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX)\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\n\nThe Higher Education Act (HEA)\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nThe Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act (WIOA)\n\nThe Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act (PERKINS)\n\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\n With respect to IDEA (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), it is my understanding that 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 states: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation.\n\n 2.Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n\n3.Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n\n4.Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\n\n The letters to rescind are:\n\nRe: Parents right to include\/invite participants to IEP meetings:\n\no    Letter to Anonymous (2003)\n\no    Letter to Byrd (2003)\n\nRe: Parent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom:\n\nLetter to Mamas (2004)\n \n\nRe: Independent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator: \n\nLetter to LaDolce (2007)\n\nRe: Failure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504: \n\nLetter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996)\n\nPlease see the attachment for complete rationale for rescinding each suggested letter.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nSeetha Burtner\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Seetha Burtner","doc.state":"MA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-13443&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Association\/Organization","doc.city":"Washington","doc.comment_body":"Please see the attached comment letter.

It would be unfathomable to determine where a student is physically located at any point in time while taking a course. Consider a student who travels for work while taking a distance education course; s\/he may be in one state on a given day, and another state on the next. \n\nReciprocity Agreement\n\nI applaud the recognition and acceptance of reciprocity agreements between states to alleviate some of the complicated, labor intensive, and many times costly, compliance requirements.  These agreements make it easier for institutions to offer, and for students to access, desired distance education courses and programs. Reciprocity agreements, such as SARA (State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement), offer a centralized authorization process, a commonality and understanding of terms of agreement, and requirements that serve to protect students.\n\nHowever, the regulations stipulate that a state authorization reciprocity agreement does not prohibit any state from enforcing its own statues and regulations.  This provision basically makes any reciprocity agreement null.\n\nProfessional Licensing\n\nCompliance with the professional licensure requirements may provide the biggest challenge. An institution is required to provide an individualized disclosure to a prospective student if a program does not meet licensure or certification prerequisites in a state of the student's residence. In the provisions, a prospective student is defined as someone who has been in contact with the institution and has requested information concerning admission. At an open access institution, anyone may apply and be admitted to the college simply by filling out an admission application on the institution's website. Prospective students may register and enroll without declaring a degree path, making it impossible to know the student's intent. Therefore, providing an individualized disclosure statement to a prospective student may not be feasible. In addition, knowing the requirements for each state's licensing boards is an arduous task at best. Finally, receiving an acknowledgement from the student that s\/he has received the communication and storing that acknowledgement would require processes in place that may need programming and would require time to develop.\n\nOverall, I would like express my concern that some of the requirements in the regulations are overly taxing on two-year public, open access institutions that may not have the same resources (both monetary and staffing), or ease of access to counsel, as four-year or for-profit institutions.  \n\nThank you for your considerations in these matters. \n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nColleen K.

The news was accompanied with a parallel diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which stems directly from the ADHD. It is of extreme importance to us that he be given every chance to thrive in the public school system. \n\nTo date, we have benefitted greatly from the public services and resources that have accompanied his diagnosis, and we strongly believe that he and other children like him should continue to receive the same level  or more  of care and attention that has been offered as a result of this guidance. \n\nADHD affects the academic progress, social success, self-esteem, and overall happiness of 6.4 million American children. Without support and adequate services to mitigate ADHD symptoms in academic and social settings, a child like ours may suffer poor grades, school failure, and long-term damage to self-esteem and learning.\n\nThe Dear Colleague Letter provides clear, well-informed guidance to help teachers and administrators identify and support struggling students with ADHD. It ensures that students with ADHD have access to a free and public education (FAPE), their guaranteed right under U.S. law. In the year since its release, the Dear Colleague Letter has received no legal, political, or scholarly objections. Furthermore, complaints to the Department of Education regarding discrimination against students with ADHD will almost surely continue to decrease as the Dear Colleague letter is adapted and heeded by schools across the country.\n\nWhen ADHD symptoms are left unaddressed at school, the entire classroom can suffer devastating consequences. By retaining the provisions outlined in the Dear Colleague Letter, the DOE is empowering schools to provide more efficient academic support, save money, and bolster their students learning opportunities. This provision does not meet the criteria for elimination. It is not outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective; it does not impose costs that exceed benefits; and it does not create a serious inconsistency. Indeed, it is essential and should remain in place.\n\nIf our sons diagnosis had not been taken seriously, we would be in dire straits right now concerning his education. Instead, he is warmly accepted by his school community and surrounded by individuals who are committed to guiding him and helping him achieve the best possible school experience. Pleasure ensure that he and other children like him all enjoy an equal opportunity to flourish. \n\nSincerely,\nJeff Lewonczyk\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Jeffrey Lewonczyk","doc.state":"NY","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-13235&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Child advocate","doc.city":"Burbank","doc.comment_body":"see attached","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Kelly Duenckel","doc.state":"CA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-13208&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Community Organization","doc.city":"Bremerton","doc.comment_body":"Please accept my uploaded letter for comment in regard to Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074 ","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Jeff Dolven","doc.state":"WA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-13206&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Child advocate","doc.comment_body":"Ms. Hilary Malawer\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Room 6E231September 18, 2017\nWashington, D.C. 20202\n\nDear Ms. Malawer:Re: ED-2017-OS-0074-0001\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Education's (ED) implementation of Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda. We are writing to urge ED's Regulatory Reform Task Force not to propose repeal, replacement or modification of any regulations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) as part of the implementation of this Executive Order.\nThrough its statutory and regulatory provisions, IDEA provides the basis for millions of children with disabilities to receive special education and related services. The requirements in the law and regulations ensure the foundation of each child's access to a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Since 1978, this has meant students in our country have had the opportunity to succeed academically, just like their non-disabled peers. This has opened the doors of success for students with disabilities to attend postsecondary education and prepare for employment. \nIDEA's regulations all have a strong statutory basis and are extensions of statutory requirements necessary for the implementation of the law. The regulations provide all parties with the necessary real world structure to implement the law. Repealing or modifying an IDEA regulation would destabilize IDEA's statutory intent.  A process that would spotlight certain regulatory requirements for repeal, replacement or modification over others would create major problems for parents, teachers and school officials. IDEA's regulatory and statutory requirements all work together to provide the foundation of FAPE for children with disabilities.\nThe notice inviting comment lists several criteria by which regulations for repeal, replacement or modification should be identified. These criteria do not relate to IDEA's regulations. The criteria include whether a regulation negatively impacts jobs or job creation; is outdated, unnecessary or ineffective; imposes costs that exceed benefits; creates serious inconsistency or interference with regulatory reform efforts; or is derived from a subsequently rescinded or modified Executive Order. IDEA's regulations do not negatively impact jobs or job creation. They are not outdated, unnecessary or ineffective, and don't impose costs the exceed benefits as they provide the foundation for FAPE. The regulations also don't impact any regulatory reform efforts and are not inconsistent with a previous Executive Order. We believe the criteria by which ED's regulations are to be judged are not applicable to IDEA's regulatory provisions. \nPlease refrain from proposing to repeal, replace or modify any regulations related to IDEA. \nSincerely,\n\nBryce LovelandKaren Taycher\nGoverning Board ChairpersonExecutive Director\n","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Karen Taycher","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-13178&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Child advocate","doc.city":"Ocoee","doc.comment_body":"Withdraw the regulation that appears at 34 CFR Part 99, which was effective January 2012 and which greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA.  \n\nWe might also look at strengthening and tightening up the privacy of our children's educational records now that ESSA mandates the school collect social and emotional data on our children.  In the digital age and with the threat of sabotage we need to roll back what Obama did and strengthen the original protections.  There are many companies getting rich off the data from our children and they pay nothing to obtain this data and now don't even have to ask for parental consent.  There is no reason why these corporations should have access to our children's information in order to make profit.  I don't want to hear it is research to develop better curriculum.

These regulations advance policy goals of providing equal access to free public education and removing educational barriers to the homeless children and youth. The federal government would not gain any visible cost savings through repealing, replacing, or modifying these regulations. Instead, it may create additional barriers to the education of homeless children and youth. Moreover, these regulations support McKinney-Vento and are crucial to providing necessary services to ensure stable and continuous education for homeless children and youth.

The National Center for Parent Leadership, Advocacy, and Community Empowerment (National PLACE) is a national non-profit organization - composed of 40+ family-led non-profits - committed to helping family-led organizations and individual families acquire the knowledge and skills needed to effectively \"sit at the table\" and influence the policies and decisions that impact the lives of children, youth, and families, including families that face the greatest challenges due to disability, special healthcare needs, poverty, and discrimination. Our mission is empowering families and family-led organizations to advocate for enhanced, meaningful parent involvement and leadership in all policy decision-making that impacts services for children and families. \n\nFamily Engagement:  Regulatory requirements related to education laws, including but not limited to the ESSA, IDEA, Section 504, Perkins Act, and FERPA pertaining to family engagement, participation, decision-making rights, and procedural safeguards to protect the parents' role(s), should NOT be eliminated or weakened.  Research demonstrates that family engagement in education leads to better outcomes for students, and it would be counterproductive to weaken or eliminate support for such engagement.  Regulations regarding Parent Centers should NOT be eliminated or weakened.  Parent Centers play a critical role in helping families understand how early intervention, special education, and transition to adult life systems work; their roles in decision-making on behalf of their individual children and in systems improvement; and how to collaborate with EI providers and schools.  Policy guidance related to family and stakeholder engagement, should NOT be eliminated or weakened, as they support the importance of the role of the intended beneficiaries of early childhood and education programs at all levels.\n\nAccountability: Regulatory requirements and other guidance related to the ability of families, stakeholders, and the public to hold EI programs and schools, including charter schools, accountable should NOT be eliminated or weakened.  These are public institutions which must be accountable to those for whom their services are intended and who are the intended beneficiaries - infants, toddlers, children, youth, young adults, and their families.  \n\nNon-Discrimination: Regulatory requirements and other guidance related to ensuring the rights of all infants, toddlers, children, youth, young adults and their families, regardless of race, ethnicity, immigrant status, economic status, language, gender, sexual orientation, family composition, religion, disability or special health\/mental health needs, or other characteristics, should NOT be eliminated or weakened.  \n\nThe Process | National PLACE is concerned about the proposed process of wholesale evaluation of existing regulations for the purpose of repeal, replacement, or modification reflected by Executive Order 13777, which we believe is both unusual and misguided.  The process of promulgating regulations is codified in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).  The ED regulations listed for possible \"repeal, replace or modify\" have already gone through the open, transparent, and prescribed procedure mandated by the APA including consideration of the costs and benefits of regulatory action and other steps that together ensure that development of regulations is based on a wide range of input and sound information.  The normal process of promulgating regulations already takes into account the factors included in Executive Order 13777.  National PLACE agrees that agencies should periodically review their regulations to ensure that they remain relevant and effective, but eliminating regulations for the sake of elimination is harmful and misguided.  No wholesale review of regulations and non-regulatory guidance, particularly within such a limited time span, can do justice to the thoughtful, participatory process needed to ensure a high-quality, fair, and equitable outcome.  Any review of regulations and guidance must be conducted thoughtfully and with the active and meaningful participation of representatives of the diverse range parents of infants, toddlers, children, youth and young adults served by and who are the intended beneficiaries of US ED-funded programs.\n\nNational PLACE strongly opposes the process itself, as well as any specific proposals to weaken regulations and non-regulatory guidance that protect our nation's most vulnerable students and the participation and involvement of their families.

As a 30 year veteran teacher, adult with Dyslexia, parent of 2 adult children with Dyslexia and a Dyslexia Practitioner of 17 years, I have seen the challenges that have been caused over the years with many of the misunderstandings created when schools avoided identifying, serving and providing accommodations for students with Dyslexia.  The recent language in ESSA, as highlighted in the \"Dear Colleague Letter:  Dyslexia Guidance\" document (dated Oct. 23rd, 2015), the case for screening, identifying, serving and providing accommodations is clearly stated.  This letter was the result of DECADES of research, study and advocacy on behalf of educators, families and individuals of all ages on behalf of those who live with Dyslexia and the challenges (and blessings) that accompany life with Dyslexia.\n\n  It is IMPERATIVE that language be retained in any educational legislation that REQUIRES public institutions to continue to identify and serve students with Dyslexia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia under the category of Learning Disabilities throughout the United States.

his third and fourth grade year. He qualified for an IEP which is now in place. I feel strongly that if he didn't have the IEP he may very well be expelled from school due to the behavior issues that come about as a result of his ADHD deficits. \n\nDespite the IEP and supports in place at school it is largely my impression that ADHD is not well understood, accepted, and accommodated to the best that it could be in our schools. I think that educators at all levels need multiple, good resources such as the guide listed above in order to assist these students or they potentially face being lost in the system. \n\nI am attaching an article regarding this very subject from Attitude Magazine's website.\n\n\"Since 1998, millions have trusted ADDitude to deliver expert advice and caring support, making us the leading media network for parents and adults living with attention-deficit disorder, and for professionals working in the field.

These regulations and guidance are having a job-killing impact for people who are blind or who have other significant disabilities.  People who face extreme barriers to employment do not need additional unnecessary harmful obstacles. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program.\n\nThe language in the integrated settings criteria guidance promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance.  Each case is to be evaluated on its own merit, not as a blanket policy as the RSA language suggests.\n\nArizona Industries for the Blind is an NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and has created over 120 good jobs whereby employees thrive in a quality work environment and earn competitive wages. We do not want to see people who are blind in our local community hindered form acquiring meaningful employment of their choice because of generalized guidance from RSA.\n\nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions through the AbilityOne program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRichard J.

Pt. 106 specifically. These regulations meet the priorities set of (i) job creation; (ii) effective policy; (iii) benefits that exceed costs; (iv) consistency with other regulatory initiatives; (v) consistency with Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516 note) and (vi) are not derived from rescinded Executive Orders or other Presidential directives.\n\nIt is vital to maintain implementing regulations under 34 C.F.R. Pt. 106, as well as guidance materials by the Office for Civil Rights explaining the requirements of 106.8 and 106.9. See U.S. Dep't of Educ., OCR, Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties (2001); U.S. Dep't of Educ., OCR, Sexual Harassment: It's Not Academic (2008); U.S. Dep't of Educ., OCR, Dear Colleague Letter (2011); U.S. Dep't of Educ., OCR, Dear Colleague Letter (2013); U.S. Dep't of Educ., OCR, Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence (2014); U.S. Dep't of Educ., OCR, Title IX Resource Guide (2015).\n\nTitle IX has led to significant job creation by bringing women into professional schools and ensuring that they are not deterred from completing their degree or academically succeeding due to sexual violence and harassment by peers, educators, or other third parties within educational institutions. Title IX has been an effective policy since 1972, having increased women's enrollment in higher education programs and professional schools and requiring campuses. The benefits derived from Title IX, creating an expanded and diverse workforce throughout the country, exceed any cost associated in an individual school ensuring compliance. Title IX is consistent with several initiatives through the federal government to ensure sex discrimination, sexual violence, and sexual harassment have no place in educational programs or activities receiving federal funding. Title IX is consistent with 44 U.S.C. 3516. Finally, Title IX is derived from the will of Congress to end sex discrimination within educational settings and neither its implementing regulations nor explanatory guidance are derived from rescinded Executive Orders or Presidential directives.\n\nTitle IX's implementing regulations and guidance are vital to protecting students and employees from sex discrimination in the form of sexual violence and harassment as such abuses effectively deny the opportunity of equal access to education. It is essential to maintain regulations and guidance that explain decades of case law and provide examples of successfully implementing civil rights on campuses are necessary to keep our campuses safe and provide all students a prompt and equitable process when discrimination, harassment and violence arise. SurvJustice therefore demands such protections stay in place as they are beneficial to society not \"unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome.\" ","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Laura Dunn","doc.state":"SurvJustice","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-11173&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Texas Association of School Boards","doc.comment_body":"Please see the attached document. \n\n","doc.country":"Jasmine Wightman","doc.name":"Jasmine Wightman","doc.state":"Association\/Organization","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-11095&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"National Council of State Agencies for the Blind (NCSAB)","doc.comment_body":"See attached file from the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind.","doc.country":"Beverlee Stafford","doc.name":"Fred Schroeder","doc.state":"Association\/Organization","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-10987&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"Excelsior College","doc.comment_body":"See Attached","doc.country":"Private\/Non-Profit Institution of Higher Education","doc.name":"James Baldwin","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-10899&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":null,"doc.city":"American Speech-Language-Hearing Association","doc.comment_body":"Comments submitted on behalf of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.","doc.country":"Catherine D.

We affirm the comments submitted by AACC and endorse the recommendations made in \"Recalibrating Regulation of Colleges and Universities: Report of the Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education,\" a bipartisan report by senators released in 2015. We urge the administration to use this report as its guide, and note the additional specific issues below.  \n\nIntegrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), 34 CFR 668\nThe Human Resources metric has been particularly problematic as college employment numbers are requested for a time period over the course of the academic year rather than for a specific snapshot in time. This measure is next to impossible to report accurately. For instance, in a given year, a number of employees will retire, resign or be terminated. And many of these employees will be replaced through new hires. Are we to report two employees for one position because both served in the given time period -- the one who retired and the one who was hired? Or is the report really seeking to know how many unique job titles\/positions were active during a given period? A better measure might be to request data for the number of employees on a given date in time, or an average number of employees over the course of the period. \n \nSecondly, in terms of student success, data are requested for the number of graduates or completers, and separately for the number students who have transferred. If a student has been reported in the graduate category, he or she cannot also be reported as having transferred. These categories, however, are not mutually exclusive in the reality of the student experience. Some students graduate and enter the workforce, others graduate and transfer, and still others transfer without graduating. As we have focused on completion, Wallace State's number of graduates has risen in the IPEDS cohort, to its most recent rate of 38 percent. However, while 25 percent of our students transfer, we are only able to report that 10 percent do, since 15 percent of those also graduated. This feels punitive, both to the college, which has a reputation as an outstanding place for students seeking academic-transfer opportunities, and to the students represented in these numbers, whose story is not accurately told. Many of our students graduate and transfer, and should be reported as such.   \n \nTitle IV - Student Loans, 34 CFR Parts 30, 668, 674, 682, and 685\nThe authorization of year-round Pell provides much-welcomed relief to community college students, especially those who are motivated to finish more quickly, and those enrolled in programs that require year-round attendance. The Pell funds awarded to students are rightly tied to the intensity of enrollment. A student enrolled part-time is awarded an amount of Pell proportional to that part-time status, so that students attending half time, are awarded half as much Pell as a student with the same level of eligibility attending full time. However, Title IV funds in the form of federal student loans have no such proportionality. We believe this puts undue risk both on the student, who will be required to repay the loan, and on the college, which is held accountable for repayment. The ability to rack up levels of debt disproportionate to the degree being pursued is not only more likely in the current scheme, but should the part-time student fail to complete, the loan repayments are also much higher than is necessary. The availability of such \"easy money\" teaches poor financial discipline and encourages over-borrowing for the degree.\n \nGainful Employment, 34 CFR Parts 600 and 668\nThe intent of gainful employment data to provide a picture of the debt-to-earnings ratio for program is admirable. However, as AACC points out, no community college in the U.S. has failed the debt-to-earnings metric. Furthermore, many applied technology courses, which are hands-on in nature and typically have lower enrollments as a result, do not meet the minimum cohort numbers required for some of the questions on the survey. And those that do rely on instructors to track employment in field for graduates from several years prior. What of the graduates who have moved, changed contact information, or otherwise lost touch? Should an instructor guess? Or should they not be reported? The very nature of this requirement would seem to lend itself to inaccurate results. And if inaccurate, then of what value is the metric? Until and unless the collection of earnings data can be automated and tied to tax returns, this measure will always be flawed.\n\nThank you.

Based on our staffs decades of experience in the field of blind services and vision rehabilitation, we know for the last 30 years, the homemaker exemption has been instrumental in the successful integration of these people back into their homes, community and workforce.\nMany of our clients lost their sight as adults and do not know how they will survive independently in their home and community without vision; much less acquire and maintain a job.  Utilizing the homemaker exemption to provide training in these instances provides clients an opportunity to regain their confidence to function independently.  Once clients have mastered basic skills, they realized they could be gainfully employed.  If it were not for the homemaker exemption, these clients may never have gained the confidence necessary to reintegrate into the workforce.  \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned people served by the homemaker exemption, we serve the growing population of senior citizens.  Americas aging population experiencing vision loss is expected to double over the next 13 years.  Fifty-four percent of the clients served by our organization last year through the homemaker exemption were over the age of 55.  As demand continues to increase, funding to serve these clients is decreasing. The dollars allocated to each state through the Older Independent Blind Grant is minimal compared to the amount of dollars needed to serve these deserving citizens.  Additionally, it is much more cost effective to help people with disabilities remain in their homes as opposed to placing them into assisted living or nursing homes.  The removal of the homemaker provision for people coping with disabilities will result in a significant increase in the number of seniors moving into more restrictive and costly settings.  \n\nIn addition to providing critical training to people through the homemaker exemption, our organization employs hundreds of people.  Fifty-two percent of our employees are blind or visually impaired, employed at all levels of the company from leadership to entry-level employees.  All workers receive good wages, a benefits package and the opportunity for upward mobility.  We exceed our direct labor requirements while being a wholly integrated workplace.  Organizations throughout the nation must be evaluated on their individual merits, not on participation in an employment programs like AbilityOne or state use.  Furthermore, job candidates must be presented with all employment choices that fit their qualification and experience.  Not-for-profits who execute AbilityOne contracts should be an option for these job seekers as these are good paying jobs with benefits.\n\nI recommend the Department of Education reconsider its decision to remove the homemaker exemption.  Additionally, the agency should determine whether an organization is a competitive work environment on a case by case basis and preserve a consumers right to choose where they want to work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nLou Moneymaker\nBosma Enterprises President & CEO\n\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Lou Moneymaker","doc.state":"IN","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-10578&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Pepperdine University","doc.city":"Malibu","doc.comment_body":"Dear Assistant Counsel Malawer:\n\nAttached please find Pepperdine University's comments on the Report of the Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education (Docket Number ED-2017-OS-0074).

We need a process that is fair and equal for All. Colleges do not allow all due process rights for those accused and the Preponderance of Evidence standard is too low. I have a vested interest as a woman and as a mother of a daughter who is about to leave for college to believe victim's\/survivors and to see those who have assaulted women brought to justice. This is a role I am a part of every day in my jobs as an emergency room nurse and as a nurse at a college, however I have also seen the other side. I have two sons one who was wrongly accused and who went through a process that was anything but fair, unbiased, equitable, that upheld due process, or allowed for the right to be heard. \nBelieve the victim no matter what, leaves the accused defending him self as guilty until proven innocent. I thought it was our constitutional right to be innocent until proven guilty. This is not true on a college campus and until this happens to you most people have a hard time believing this. I am attaching my son's story showing the bias and inequities in the system and how my son was treated along with a copy of my son's student rights at his college. \nTrauma Informed Prevention is the \"Public Health Perspective\" that has taken hold over the last eight years. This thought process is pervasive throughout the CDC and the DOJ. Many of these studies seem to have been funded through the VAWA. A Trauma Informed Approach according to the Director of Community Living on our campus states; \"It guides us to approach all students as though they have experienced abuse, regardless of whether they have or not.\" I feel like I need to repeat that. Treat the student as though they have been assaulted even if they have not. It only matters that they believe they were assaulted. Is it not important to look at both sides?

Our son is 9-years-old and is in the mainstream with a Paraprofessional*. Through a mediated agreement with our school district we agreed to the terminology Paraprofessional* because the term Intervener is not recognized as a related service. The uphill battle to have our district recognize the needs of our Deafblind child and that there are professionals out there to support his needs was one feat. Once we overcame the education aspect of the role of the intervener we then had to settle with the term Paraprofessional* because there is no such terminology under IDEA for an Intervener. Our mediation was costly, both for our child in losing access to the curriculum and for us financially. Including such language as an Intervener, and all that the intervener provides to Deafblind children, is an important step in educating this small but important demographic. Our hope for our Deafblind child, and countless others, is to be happy, successful and participate in society.

An intervener is someone who has gone through specialized training in deafblindness to work one-on-one with a person who is deafblind.  General educational assistants, even knowing American Sign Language or supports for visual impairments, do not have the level of training\/education to properly support a child with deafblindness.  As a parent, I do not have all the supporting facts readily available, but there are several organizations that have proven the value of interveners as a related service and are helping to standardize their training and qualifications such as National Center on Deaf-Blindness and the Minnesota DeafBlind Project (see A-Familys-Guide-to-Interveners for more information about interveners).  In following E.O. 13777, I will attempt to address the issues raised with modifying this regulation.\n(i) Eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation;  No, it should not eliminate jobs but rather provide support for specifically trained personnel in the school system.\n(ii) Are outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective;  No, interveners have been shown to be highly effective related service for individuals with deafblindness.\n(iii) Impose costs that exceed benefits;  I do not have hard data on this, but I believe most children with deafblindness already receive one-on-one support, just not necessarily from a trained intervener.  The National Center on Deaf-Blindness does have Online Web Access modules for people to receive free intervener education and has developed a national certification process for interveners.  Having specially trained personnel provide support with individuals with deafblindness should result in better outcomes that will reduce total costs in the long run.\n(iv) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with regulatory reform initiatives and policies;  No, just as interpreters are a recognized related service for children with deafness, an intervener should be a related service for those that are deafblind.\n(v) Are inconsistent with the requirements of section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516 note), or the guidance issued pursuant to that provision, in particular those regulations that rely in whole or in part on data, information, or methods that are not publicly available or that are insufficiently transparent to meet the standard for reproducibility; or Not sure exactly, but the rationale to include interveners and data to support it should be publicly available, since most support comes from the National Center on Deaf-Blindness.\n(vi) Derive from or implement Executive Orders or other Presidential directives that have been subsequently rescinded or substantially modified.\"  Not applicable.\n\nBottom Line:  I am a parent of a child with CHARGE Syndrome, which is the leading cause of deaf-blindness.  My daughter that is deafblind has received intervener services from her school for the past two years through her IEP and it has been a critical support for the academic progress she has made.  This past year, her intervener facilitated our daughter's access to information which has greatly increased her desire to read and explore her world, including developmentally appropriate socialization with her peers.  From this experience, we can look back when our daughter only had a special education one-on-one and some of the ways that person unintentionally inhibited her progress, simply because she did not have specialized training.  For example, that person was a fluent signer but was not always signing within our daughter's communication bubble (i.e. outside her visual field) so our daughter simply didn't know she was being communicated with.  This aide was a wonderful person but didn't have the education to communicate effectively or give our daughter access to information and her environment.  This is why specially trained people called interveners are so important as a related service in IEPs for children that are deafblind.

I have daughters in college, and how college handle such things are very important. In addition to that, it seems very clear that many colleges have mishandled many of the cases that have come before them, sometimes favoring the accused, other times in favor of the accusers. It seems apparent that most colleges are far more interested in protecting themselves, not their students. There for we must put in place guidelines that are clearly defined that protect all students, establish protections and assistance to be made available for all students in need, and give direction on due process protections that should be common sense. \n\nAttached you will find my thoughts on what a college system should look like, giving protections for all students. I have copied and pasted the introduction and the closing in here, but the entire document should be read. \n\nPut in place strict guidelines that protect all students. Make it clear these are not optional. In cases where crimes have alleged to have occurred, any and all efforts to get the police to take the case should be priority. If the accuser refuses, then all efforts must be made to protect both students until one is found at fault with a high degree of certainty and while observing rules of due process. Also, any result, both a finding of responsible or not, should be easily and quickly reviewed by both State and Federal. If they see the college has failed to live up to its promise of neutrality and fairness, the state can override the punishment. \n\nI would also suggest that someone should do a case by case review of all cases over the last 6 years. If Allegany, UCL, U of Cincinnati, Amherst, and Colorado State University can have cases where they so clearly got it wrong and settled in lawsuits, it stands to reason that they among many other colleges got it wrong with students who simply do not have the ability to sustain a 2 to 3 year lawsuit. At the very least, these students who would not have been found responsible under a fair system should get a refund from the college for their tuition, meal plans and housing fees, and have their records expunged. Accusation doesn't equal guilt, and to presume it does not only does a grave injustice to those who are falsely accused, but it also undermines confidence in the existing system. \n\nColleges should not be quasi-judicial systems. They simply are not capable. Their job should be to protect students, all students. If a student wants justice or punishment, that is what the criminal courts are for. They also have the ability to civilly sue the person they say is responsible. If a college is forced to hold hearing, it must take pains to make sure it's staying as a neutral fact finder. \n\nI would also suggest that some of the OCR offices on colleges, such as the ones who have ignored exculpatory evidence, or those who have expelled students when the 'victim' insisted they were innocent, lose their jobs. Only when colleges understand not doing their job correctly will result in personal loss will they change. If any student has been suspended or expelled without being allowed a hearing, knowing the charges they were accused of, unable to have any meaningful form of cross examination, or any other clear breach of normal due process, then the college needs to expunge their record, offer a letter taking fault, refund money paid and re-enroll the student asap with assistance if needed. The exceptions to this would be if there was an independent inquiry, such as a criminal case, or a lawsuit that established guilt. If the criminal case resulted in a not guilty, or less, then these consequences for the college should be automatic. \n\nIn short, the ability to get academic accommodations, movement in and out of classes, or dorms, the ability to get counseling, and the ability to get basic NCO should be made easier for all. Advocates should be automatic.\n\nBut the ability to suspend or expel students needs to be much harder.\n\nColleges should first Educate, then Correct bad behavior, then Protect, and only in extreme cases where there is ample proof, Punish. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. \n\nVincent Morrone \n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Vincent Morrone","doc.state":"NY","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-9783&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Community Organization","doc.city":"Oklahoma City","doc.comment_body":"As the CEO of NewView Oklahoma, an AbilityOne participating agency and the largest employer of people who are blind in the State of Oklahoma and an employer of people who are blind in 6 other states, I would like to comment on rules issued in August 2016 regarding the implementation of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).  Regulations issued by the Department of Education are creating a negative impact for people who are blind across the country.\n\nNumber 1: The Department's interpretation of \"Competitive Integrated Employment\" is denying individuals who are blind opportunities for good jobs and upwardly mobile career path.  Language included in the preamble of the WIOA final rule identifies job opportunities in an AbilityOne affiliated organization are not deemed to meet the definition of competitive integrated employment.  As a result, no job opportunities at a non-profit organization holding an AbilityOne or state use contract qualify as a successful employment outcome, resulting in denial of individuals to receive additional services through state vocational rehabilitation programs.  This denies individuals who are blind the opportunity to gain self-sufficiency and independence by closing the door to work that pays solid wages, offers good benefits and has a pathway to upward mobility and career development.  Merely because of association with AbilityOne, jobs within our agency are deemed not real jobs because they are not \"typically found in the community\".  NewView provides a work environment typically found in the community, providing high skilled manufacturing jobs, administrative positions, professional positions, call center jobs and many more.  We offer full time employment with pay well above minimum wage, full benefit package including paid health insurance and retirement benefits.  Conversely, the Department of Education\/RSA considers part-time work with undetermined work hours, at minimum wage with no benefits to be considered integrated competitive employment and will favor these outcomes over positions offered through NewView Oklahoma and agencies like ours across the country.  This decision is arbitrary and counterproductive in promoting self-sufficiency and economic independence.  \n\nOur agency does not endorse the payment of sub-minimum wage nor are we a sheltered work shop.  We offer full wage and benefit eligible positions that are not considered acceptable employment options for our resident's who are blind because the job is within an organization who employs a high percentage of individuals who have vision impairments.  We have numerous individuals working at our agency now that literally sat at home for years receiving services from vocational rehabilitation with no employment prospects until they found NewView.  No one should be denied the opportunity to work or receive services by the mere fact they work next to someone with a disability.  I urge you to seek an amendment to the rules that eliminates any bias against the employer, including those non-profit agencies holding AbilityOne or state use contracts and instead weigh the value of the employment on the critical values determined in the statute including compensation, benefits, opportunities for career advancement and informed choice.  Where a person works and who they work with should not in and of itself be a disqualifying factor for a successful employment outcome and access to services.\n\nNumber 2:  We are asking that the Homemaker Outcome (uncompensated outcome) be reinstated as this rule ignores the vital role this exemption has for individuals who are blind.  Prior to the WIOA final rules, individuals who are blind could qualify for vocational rehabilitation services including services for independent living as homemakers.  Eliminating this outcome was purely discretionary and problematic as this decision disproportionately impacts people who are blind.  As one gentleman once told me, \"You have to live to work\".  The United States government has defined blindness as a catastrophic disability.  The adjustment to blindness is neither easy nor rapid and in many instances, an individual cannot imagine how they are going to live with blindness and certainly cannot imagine how they would work.  In addition, vision rehabilitation is not covered under insurance so without access to services through the vocational rehabilitation system, there is no question that a person cannot effectively find work.  Thus, we are asking for an immediate reinstatement of the Homemaker Outcome.

HCC is located in Columbia Maryland.  We enrolled 14,467 credit students in FY2016 and 15,571 noncredit continuing education students.  Almost a quarter of graduating seniors from Howard County high schools in 2016 enrolled at HCC in Fall 2016, and 42% of undergraduate students living in the county attend HCC.  The average age of our student is 26 years old and 37% of our students enroll fulltime.  Forty-eight percent (48%) of fall 2016 credit students received financial aid during their enrollment at HCC.   Seventy-one percent (71%) of our aid recipients are Pell Grant students.  Thirty percent (30%) of our aid recipients borrowed from the student loan programs, which is 10% of our enrolled students.\n\nWe concur with the comments submitted by the American Association of Community Colleges, and would like to emphasize a few of the points made by AACC in the comments below.\n\nProgram Integrity:  Gainful Employment Regulations\n\nWe are pleased that ED has already undertaken the process to reopen negotiated rulemaking proceedings to modify the gainful employment (GE) regulations.  We agree with the basic approach to create GE eligibility metrics for individual GE programs, which show whether students who complete GE programs are subsequently able to repay their student loans without undue burden in a reasonable time period. Our understanding is that the vast majority of community college GE programs were never in any danger of failing the debt-to-earnings metric (and none did).    Howard Community College has 27 GE programs, and only one program had earnings published (verified student count of 17 with median earnings  of $60,704 and mean earnings of $58,273) and no programs had a sufficient number of borrowers for a debt to earnings ratio to be published.   The cost of implementing the GE regulations is enormous, involving staff across many academic and administrative office, and there was no benefit to our students.\n\nWe recommend that the GE regulations should exempt institutions and\/or programs that have a history of low borrowing. Most community colleges have well below 50% of their students borrowing federal loans.   Only about 10% of HCC's enrolled students borrow from the loan program, and even far less than that percentage of students who are enrolled specifically in the GE programs.    Therefore we recommend that our GE programs should be exempted from the current GE reporting regulations and any new GE regulations, other than some basic program disclosures referred to below. \n\nAdditionally, we agree with AACC's recommendation that a minimum threshold be set for the number of Title IV students enrolled in the program in order to require reporting on GE programs to align with confidentiality and other rules. This includes almost all of HCC's GE programs.\n\nReturn of Title IV Funds:  \n\nThese regulations are the most complex of the Title IV regulations and they are the most difficult to implement in a community college.  The complexity of these regulations basically requires that these calculations be done manually.   The complexity is not in the math, but in the gathering of the correct enrollment data for the calculation.   The reason why this area remains one of the top 3 findings in program reviews and audits for the past decade is not because colleges do not put the time and effort into complying, it's because it's too complex to automate and too complex to be able to reliably do a manual calculation for hundreds of students each term.   HCC has surveyed other community colleges and on average, it takes about 30 minutes per withdrawn student to complete the r2t4 calculation process from start to finish.   The ACE report proposes modifications to several provisions of these regulations to ease the burden of compliance. \n\nVerification and ISIR Comment Codes: \n\nIt's the highest need students, Pell eligible applicants, who are most subject to having to gather additional documentation to validate the information they submitted on the FAFSA.   This occurs as a part of the verification process and also through various comment codes assigned by the U.S. Department of Education on the ISIR.Simplifying the FAFSA but increasing the complexity of the documentation required to complete the file does not improve access for high need students.   We recommend that the simplification approach be also applied on the \"back end\" to make it easier for students to complete their financial aid file.   One critical issue that we hope doesn't occur again is the shutdown of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA. \n\nThank you for your consideration of these comments.

We \nunderstand that comments are being received as it relates to repealing, adjusting and\/or changing the rulemaking related to \nthe Javits Wagner O'Day Act under what is known as AbilityOne, and the treatment of those opportunities as not \"competitive\nand integrated\" for the purposes of WIOA. Our comments support maintaining the current regulations as they exist, in \nparticular, as they relate to the treatment of AbilityOne programs as being defined as not \"competitive and integrated\" for \nthe purposes of WIOA.\n\nAbilityOne, the brand name for the implementation of the Javits Wagner O'Day Act (JWOD), passed in 1938, and refreshed \nin 1971, is charged with providing training and employment opportunities to people who are blind or severely disabled. The \nprogram effectively merged (as was the purpose of such Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) programs) the training with \nemployment for people with disabilities. The passage of WIOA and subsequent rulemaking provided an opportunity to \nbifurcate the two functions, particularly for those providing employment and training to people with disabilities.\n\nIt is my contention that the WIOA rulemaking as it relates to sheltered workshops, of which JWOD is, marks the \nculmination of a long progression of civil rights development to shift from segregation of people with disabilities in the \nemployment realm. WIOA will ensure that a managerial shift of those organizations currently operating under JWOD \nwill have to synthesize with the new regulations and will simply be formalizing what is already occurring in the disability \nemployment and training community. Moreover, many advocates for people with disabilities see sheltered workshops as \nlimiting for those who are employed in them, particularly where direct labor requirements are employed.\n\nAbilityOne nonprofits are one of the largest employers of people with disabilities in the nation, and the federal \ngovernment's paradoxical position on the matter is one which must be reconciled. However, such a reconciliation \nis for participants in the program to synthesize, and options are available AbilityOne nonprofits to become \nCompetitive and Integrated under the WIOA law. A solution has been presented to Congress and the Section 809\npanel in the form of a White Paper (attached below). Fundamentally, the DEd got the regulations correct. Pushing \nAbilityOne to have to adjust to the modern work environment, and examining how JWOD fits the modern economy, \nis an essential part of the regulations. The intent is to mainstream Competitive and Integrated opportunities and I \nstrongly believe the WIOA regulations are the right direction to meet that objective. Alternatively, maintaining the \nstatus quo will be a huge step back from the Competitive and Integrated push for people with disabilities. Please \nsee the attached White Paper for further detail on the role WIOA and JWOD could play with ensuring \nCompetitive and Integrated opportunities for those with disabilities. \n","doc.country":null,"doc.name":"Anonymous Anonymous","doc.state":null,"doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-9431&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"National Disability Rights Network","doc.city":"Washington DC","doc.comment_body":"NDRN rejects the notion that the process the Department is engaging in, in response to Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda, will benefit the 50.4 million K-12 students and will aid the Department in fulfilling its stated mission to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.

Headquartered in New Britain, CT, we employ over 1,000 individuals with significant disabilities in meaningful and well-paying jobs throughout the country, many of whom are employed at military bases and prestigious government facilities as a direct result of the AbilityOne program.  \nOur comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations and guidance are stripping away the rights of people with disabilities by closing off meaningful and well-paying jobs for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \nIn the absence of the AbilityOne program, many of the individuals we serve would not be employed or would be working in lower paying positions with minimal to no benefits.  The unemployment rate for people with disabilities continues to be high, despite good intentions and various policies designed to increase employment.  Eliminating and limiting job opportunities for any group of people, specifically for people with significant disabilities is unfair and disheartening. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA not only restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities; it is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance. As an employer in a number of states, some of the vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies are discounting any AbilityOne job which is problematic and can lead to unfilled positions.  \nWe respectfully request that the DoEd immediately rescind the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne Program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). This is an Employment First approach which not only supports \n\nindividual choice but will lead to the employment for many individuals with significant disabilities in the future. \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSandra M.

We have a son with a rare syndrome called Pallister Killian Syndrome. He is 1 of 2 in the state of MN to have this. Our son has severe medical issues along with deaf\/blindness. We live in the greater Minnesota region, so we do not have access to some of the schools where they have supports for this type of student. We have spent the last 9 years trying to educate our schools on how they can help our son. We knew early on about Interveners and had them in our home setting where we witnessed their profound impact on communication and connecting with our son. They have helped us gain tools to connect with our son when we didn't think it was possible. This has been transformational in a very unique situation that empowered us as a family to do all we could to help him understand his world around him. It wasn't until we had gone to mediation with the school due to differences in what they thought our son needed in the education system, where they finally brought in some Deaf\/Blind Professionals who helped point out where his education was lacking. Mostly it was communication. Our son was 11 years old at this point and still didn't have a formal communication plan in school. If you can only imagine not hearing, not seeing and not connecting with your world for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week with people who did not understand you. I beg of you to push for this wording. We are a very small group but our kids CAN learn. They deserve a voice and to be heard. They just need a different way of doing so. With this regulation added to the list of related services, our children will have a chance to a meaningful education. This will save so much unnecessary grief for both the family and school system, but mostly, it will provide the student with an education that is appropriate for their disability of access.

IDEA and these regulations are critical to continuing the progress made over the last 30 years to ensure young children with or at risk for disabilities and their families receive the services they need to reach their full potential. The Division for Early Childhood (DEC) of the Council for Exceptional Children is the largest membership organization focused solely on the development and education of young children (ages birth8) with or at risk for disabilities and other special needs and their families. As such, DEC sees no need for repeal, replacement or modification of any IDEA regulations at this time and notes that changes to regulations are better addressed in the context of a reauthorization.  The current process is outside of the usual order, and as a result, is likely to lack the in-depth stakeholder input and public discussion critical to the success of such an activity.   \n\nIDEA and its implementing regulations are designed to address both access to early intervention and special education for children with disabilities, as well as the quality of those services. IDEA Parts A, B and C, outline the rights, responsibilities and infrastructures to ensure access to early intervention and education for eligible children and their families. In Part D, IDEA provides for investments in the quality of those services and infrastructures. Part D provides funding for parent support and information centers and the demonstration and dissemination of evidence-based, effective practices.\n\nThere is no doubt in the field of education and in the experiences of families, that IDEA is a success. Certainly, there are challenges in implementing such a broad and visionary policy and federal action can indeed assist in these efforts. But the answer to these challenges is not to revise or reduce IDEA regulations.  Quite the contrary, these regulations support efforts to implement IDEA successfully.  Fully funding IDEA federally would go a long way to addressing the challenges states and communities are facing.  \n\nIDEA has a federal infrastructure that implementation science tells us is necessary for the installation of effective practices. This infrastructure includes guidance from OSEP in best practice, accountability, and monitoring. For the early childhood provisions of IDEA (Part C and Section 619 of Part B), OSEP provides policy guidance as needed to state leaders to assist in their efforts to help local early intervention programs and school districts implement effective policies, practices and accountability measures while also holding them accountable to indicators of compliance and quality. \n\nIDEA early childhood programs also serve as a key mechanism of supports and services for young children with disabilities in community settings such as preschool, Head Start, Home Visiting and child care\/early learning.  DEC appreciates the valuable policy guidance that has been released in the last several years through collaboration across federal programs in the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services as well as other federal agencies as needed.  This federal collaborative work has resulted in the release of a number of powerful policy statements from the respective Secretaries to assist local programs serving young children in understanding best practice giving all young children opportunities to succeed and be ready for school. DEC requests that the Department continue these efforts.  State and community leaders speak very highly of these policy statements and express how their use has helped further efforts for young children and families at the community level.  Examples of these policy statements include, but are not limited to, high quality inclusion, reducing and eliminating suspension and expulsion, and strengthening partnerships with families. \n\nDECs membership, representing all states, includes a diverse population of teachers, related service personnel, administrators, families, higher education faculty, and researchers. \n\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this important matter. DEC is available and willing to provide any additional information that may be needed.  Feel free to contact us if we may be of further assistance. \n\nSincerely,\nPeggy Kemp\nExecutive Director\n","doc.country":"United States","doc.name":"Peggy Kemp","doc.state":"VA","doc.zip":null},{"doc.attachment_download ":"","doc.attachment_download -href":"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/contentStreamer?documentId=ED-2017-OS-0074-8568&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=msw12","doc.attachment_name":null,"doc.category":"Community Organization","doc.city":"Roseville","doc.comment_body":"Ms. Hilary Malawer\nAssistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Ave SW., Room 6E231\nWashington, DC 20202\nVia electronic submission at http:\/\/www.regulations.gov\nRe: Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\nOur comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious, job-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the department's longstanding practice and technical guidance. My state's vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency is one of at least 19 states VR that have stopped referring and placing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program. \nPRIDE Industries is an NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and creates over 2100   jobs through this program. The average pay on these jobs is over 16.00 per hour with full benefits.   Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased employment opportunities at my agency are going un-filled.

Preponderance is a fine standard for conduct or Title IX cases as there is no removal of liberty or assignment of damages (as would be in a criminal proceeding or a civil lawsuit). Higher education is a privilege, not a right. Many forget that. The worst we can do in our system is remove a person from our environment, that does not preclude them from going elsewhere or require jail time or large damages to be awarded to another party. I do think more training should be done around preponderance and appropriate evaluation of evidence. \n\nAdditionally, I would like to see more guidance\/regulation on a true Trauma-Informed approach to this work. There is one or two sentences in previous issued guidance that provides opportunity for this in our work, however, the fear of an OCR investigation has pushed institutions to mandate investigations and launch inquiries on those who report, whether they want an investigation or not. The guidance on health and safety risks to the reporter and community is over broad, and oftentimes viewed as all instances are a health and safety risk, therefore must be explored.

CAMBA is dedicated in joining with our colleagues in the following:\n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter affirms the 2001 Dear Colleague Letter, namely, reiterating the government's position that universities are charged with the responsibility to take immediate and effective steps to timely respond to sexual violence and sexual discrimination. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter affirms that: \no   Every school must have and distribute a policy against sexual discrimination\no   Every school must have a Title IX coordinator whose responsibilities are oversee individual complaints of sexual discrimination and act to address any patterns or systemic problems of sexual violence and sexual discrimination \no   Every school must have and make known a procedure for students to file complaints of sexual discrimination \n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter also affirms the rights of both the complainant and the respond during the university Title IX process. The DCL recognizes that for the Title IX process to be legitimate, it's essential that both students engage with a process that is fair and equitable. The DCL outlines the following: \no   Both parties must be notified in writing regarding the outcome of the complaint and their right to an appeal \no   The complaint is investigated adequately, reliably, and impartially \no   There is a designated and reasonably prompt time frame for major stages of the process\no   Universities must use the preponderance of evidence standard. The preponderance of evidence standard is consistent with the standard of proof established for violations of civil rights laws. \no   Both parties must have an equal opportunity to present relevant witness and other evidence. \no   Both parties must be afforded similar and timely access to any information that will be used in the Title IX hearing\no   If the university permits lawyers in the process, then both parties must have the option to choose a lawyer\no   All university personnel who are involved in the Title IX process, must have training or experience in handling complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. \nThe OCR must continue to investigate universities that do not adhere to these standards so that the integrity of the process is maintained. Currently, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter provides timely, necessary, and effective regulation to support universities in their responsibility to students. There is no reason to rescind the 2011 Dear Colleague letter, or the 2001 Dear Colleague Letter, when both documents provide the necessary foundation for universities to be successful in their responsibilities to students and their families. \n","159":"My son has hydrocephalus , he was born with it.

FERPA had to be gutted in order to have access to the data and allow third party entities access as long as they can deem themselves as educational agencies. This has eliminated parental authority and oversight. State longitudinal data systems and open access to student data has redefined the purpose of the classroom and my opinion, the demise of the classroom. American students and their data is a high commodity. The mere implosion of data collection on American students status post the FERPA revisions demonstrates that data mining is the bloodline to federal control.

I am acting independent of my role and institution. I write with grave concern. \n\nI have witnessed the positive impact of Title IX guidance from OCR across the country. Survivors previously frightened to come forward have braved the silence and shared their stories. Campuses have become safer as perpetrators of violence, which research informs are likely re-perpetrators of violence, are sanctioned and, when appropriate, removed from campuses. While the system is not perfect and institutions have some ongoing questions and challenges, the overall shift has been positive.  \n\nFirst, I affirm the preponderance of evidence as the appropriate evidentiary standard in disciplinary proceedings. Considering the most extreme potential penalty to be imposed (never to exceed anything beyond expulsion), a standard beyond preponderance of evidence is not proportional to the potential sanctions. \n\nIt is important to consider that when institutions when looking at Title IX-related issues, they are basing responses on policies. Essentially, they are determining whether or not students have abided by the policies they have agreed to live by. This occurs for a range of behaviors, including other types of potentially criminal conduct - underage drinking, bullying behavior, physical assaults, drug use\/selling, etc. Institutions determine whether policies have been violated and if so, the appropriate sanctions, up to temporary or permanent dismissal. Why should the issue of sexual violence be any different? Higher education bodies are NOT legal systems, nor should they operate as such. In addition, preponderance of evidence is the standard for other concerns, such as relating to Title VII issues. It is logical and necessary for the standard to be consistent. \n\nThere is a purpose for the criminal process and court system. However, this is not a replacement for how campuses respond to issues of conduct. We should not force campuses to become legal systems nor should we equate the accountability within their scope with that of a criminal system. Schools never have at their disposal the power of subpoena, criminal discovery processes, or crime labs, nor should they. As schools are not determining violation of a criminal statute nor issuing the relevant penalty if guilty, why should aspects of this system become the standard? It is impossible to meet the clear and convincing standard without these tools. Schools determine whether or not a policy has been violated and if so, the student is responsible. They do not determine guilt. \n\n Both schools and the criminal system serve an important role in creating safer communities, holding perpetrators accountable, and providing options for survivors. In my experience as well as indicated through research, the barriers student survivors experience often detract from a choice to pursue a criminal report. This option should be within their scope of possibility, but not a requirement. Otherwise, the impact on individual survivors can deeply and negatively affect their healing journey and life choices and experiences for years, if not decades. And when national statistics indicate 20-25% of college-age women, not including men, experience sexual violence during their college years, we are looking at an impact on a significant percentage of our wider community and its families for decades to come. \n\nDecades of scholarships exists understanding the needs those impacted by violence and abuse. It is important to note that care for acute wellness and educational civil rights needs of survivors exist separately from and not mutually exclusive to potential accountability. In addition, there is a common misconception that respondents in Title IX cases experience trauma. While they likely experience stress and even crisis, they cannot experience trauma as the DSM-5 clearly outlines, trauma can only occur with exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. There is a false equivalency in these experiences and the direct physiological impact of both experiences. As there are distinct differences, research supports the use of trauma-informed investigation protocols for procedural equity. \n\nLastly, I strongly support the option for those participating in the process to have an advisor of their choice in a non-speaking role, including an attorney. However, given the above information regarding how institutions do not and should not have access to evidence which a criminal justice system does, incorporating formal legal representation into cases is in-congruent. Furthermore, it creates inequity in a process specifically designed to promote and reinforce equity. For instance, not all individuals can afford an attorney, let alone one of the same caliber. Incorporating attorneys in this manner violates Title IX at its core. \n\nSincerely,\nConstance Adams","175":"REGULATION ID:  ED-2015-OSERS-0001-1167 (Date Posted Aug 19, 2016\nRIN: 1820-AB70 CFR: 34; CFR Parts 361.5, 363 and 397\nFederal Register Number: 2016-15980 AND\nDocket ID - ED-2017-OS-0074-0001\nALL above inhibit job creation and eliminate job opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\nRehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) Regulations \"Over reach\"original statute passed by Congress.  \nThere is dignity in work.  Americans with disabilities must be able to choose where they work and what work they want to do  just like Americans without disabilities.  Having a job is the foundation of attaining the American Dream.  \n\nAmericans with disabilities have the ability and desire to seek employment of their choice that provides opportunities to earn competitive wages an benefits, to reach his\/her maximum potential, to achieve economic self-sufficiency, to contribute to the sustainability of our communities, and the opportunity to be treated as equal members of the American workforce. \n\nWhy would the federal government, through regulations and subsequent guidance to states, want to limit job opportunities and choice for Americans with disabilities when the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities hoovers around 70-75% year after year?    People with disabilities want and deserve a full array of options.  A definition that limits their menu of choices will not lead to further integration, but will reduce opportunities and cost individuals with disabilities good jobs. \n\nThe definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)) was rewritten and re-defined during the regulatory process.  The Department of Education changed what Congress intended by narrowing and limiting what qualifies as \"competitive integrated employment\".  This narrow definition should be eliminated and replaced with the definition in the WIOA statute until a broader, more expansive definition that does not eliminate job opportunities and choice can be put in its place. \n\nIn both the definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (CIE) and the definition of \"integrated setting\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(32)), the Department describes integration occurring at the \"work unit\" level.  This language is not found in the WIOA statute.  It was added by RSA in the regulatory process and must be eliminated.   It only targets individuals who work through providers of services to people with disabilities, which is inherently unfair and treats people with disabilities differently from the workforce at large.  The narrow interpretations of \"Community Integrated Employment (CIE)\" and integrated settings have ultimately eliminated work opportunities for people with disabilities. \n\nAbilityOne - Integrated AbilityOne (JWOD) employment that includes full wages, benefits and promotional opportunities must be included in the definition of \"Competitive Integrated Employment\"  RSA's regulatory re-definition of Competitive Integrated Employment restricts access to quality competitive, integrated jobs for people with significant disabilities, is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, longstanding practice and technical guidance, limits the ability of state VR program counselors to best determine the needs and competitive job fit for their individual clients with significant disabilities, and discriminates against not-for-profit employers of individuals with significant disabilities. AbilityOne employment settings offer integration, excellent wages, benefits and promotion and out placement opportunities.\n\nThe DOE and the RSA did not stop with the narrow interpretation of competitive integrated employment. They added a presumption that jobs falling under programs intended to employ people with disabilities would not qualify as an employment outcome under the law.  RSA incorporated this message into FAQs that the RSA posted on January 18, 2017.  It is also a message that RSA has delivered to State VR offices.  Some State VR offices have stopped referring people with disabilities to good jobs with benefits that meet their needs, including jobs under the federal AbilityOne program or State Set-Aside programs.  This is not what Congress intended.  The January 18, 2017 FAQs represent a significant change of federal policy and turn the purpose of WIOA on its head.  The FAQs are costing individuals with disabilities good jobs with benefits.  DOE should eliminate the FAQs and RSA should advise State VR offices that AbilityOne jobs do qualify as competitive integrated employment.  \n\nYouth - Section 511 of WIOA - Young adults with disabilities who want to work also should be permitted to work whenever possible.  Section 511 is being interpreted through some State VR agencies to prevent people with disabilities who are under the age of 25 from working under 14(c) certificates even when there is no job for them elsewhere.  This must change.  It does not benefit a person who wants to work to be placed in a day program or left at home. \n \n\n \n","176":"Weakening FERPA in 2008 and 2011 via Rule Change by the US Department of Ed bypassed Congress and weakened FERPA.

Title IX pushes schools to expand options and develop different methods of support for survivors, from providing free counseling services on campus; to allowing a survivor to change their history lecture in order to not have to learn in the same class as the person who harmed them; to ensuring that disciplinary proceedings are completed in a timely manner which is respectful of the short time a student spends at an educational institution.

At our 2017 National Convention, two resolutions were passed that profoundly shift our focus towards ensuring that Department of Education regulations meet quality standards for ensuring the academic and career development of our military and veterans. \n\nResolution No. 78: Support Greater GI Bill Outcomes by Closing 90-10 Loophole represents The American Legion's first definitive statement on the Higher Education Act's 90\/10 calculation provision, and articulates support for withdrawing Title 38 benefits from the 90-10 calculation.\n\nResolution No. 82: Preserve Veteran and Servicemember Rights to Gainful Employment and Borrower Defense Protections represents The American Legion's definitive support for the intent of the Gainful Employment Rule, as well as the insistence that veterans are represented on negotiated rulemaking committees.\n\nWe applaud President Trump's signing of Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,\" in order to alleviate unnecessary burdens on the American people- and believe that these two resolutions identify specific regulations that match the criteria by which the Executive Order defines value. Specifically, the Executive Order asks that the Department of Education Regulatory Reform Task Force identify regulations that:\n\n(i) Eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation;\n(ii) Are outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective;\n(iii) Impose costs that exceed benefits;\n(iv) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with regulatory reform initiatives and policies;\n(v) Are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, or the guidance issued pursuant to that provision;\n(vi) Derive from or implement Executive Orders or other Presidential directives that have been subsequently rescinded or substantially modified\". \n\nAlthough not an existing regulation, the guidance directed by Executive Order 13777 clearly defines the reasons for legislative action to close the 90-10 loophole. Currently, it is the lack of regulation that imposes costs that exceed benefits through the 90\/10 loophole. The 90-10 rule was based on the principle that schools need to receive at least 10% of their tuition from non-federal funding, in order to ensure quality assurance and private sector endorsement. With GI Bill funds counting as a proxy for non-federal funding, over 200 schools have been able to leave taxpayers on the hook for tuition for over 90% of their funding. It can therefore be argued that the lack of regulation imposes costs that exceed benefits; which significantly weighed into the American Legion's passage of Resolution 78 closing the 90\/10 loophole.\n\nResolution 82 covers an existing regulation that not only meets the criteria of Executive Order 13777, but literally expresses its intent: gainful employment.\n\nOne of the most pertinent sections of 13777 is identifying regulations that \"eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation\". There are thousands of regulations across the federal government which may fall under this category, the Gainful Employment rule is one of the few that seeks to accomplish the exact opposite. While the Department of Education is establishing a rainmaking committee to revisit the provisions of this rule, The American Legion looks forward to supporting the initial intent of this regulation in a manner that reduces burdens for useful and legitimate programs.","186":"Hilary Malawer, Esq.\n\nAssistant General Counsel\n\nOffice of the General Counsel\n\nUnited States Department of Education\n\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW\n\nRoom 6E231\n\nWashington, DC 20202\n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments in regard to the Regulatory Reform Project.\n\nAs a person who works in the disability employment field, I know how difficult it is for people with disabilities to interview for and be offered employment.

We strongly believe that all students deserve and are entitled to a quality education in an environment free of violence.  Unfortunately, this is not a reality for many students with marginalized identities, especially students who identify as people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, and Muslims.  When a school or school district perpetrates or allows violence, civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in.  In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We fully support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.  Which is why, we oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nThrough our community work, we know firsthand that LGBTQ students face extensive barriers to educational success.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report that found 17.8% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students have been forced to have sexual intercourse compared to 5.4% of heterosexual high school students. The largest national survey examining the experiences of transgender people in the U.S. found that 13% of respondents who were out or perceived as transgender in K-12 were sexually assaulted because of their gender identity. This same report also found that 54% of Transgender K-12 students have experienced verbal harassment, and 24% were physically attacked.  This violence and mistreatment was so pervasive that 17% of transgender students left a K-12 school, and 6% were expelled. For transgender individuals who continued onto college or vocation school, 24% experienced verbal, physical, or sexual harassment during their high education experience. The 2015 AAU Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct determined that 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, and non-conforming) college students have been sexually assaulted, compared to 18% of non-TGQN females, and 4% of non-TGQN males. Any rollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of LGBTQ student survivors, making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they experience their school environments.\n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all students. We urge you not to roll-back these protections. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs\n","191":"As a sexual assault survivor, having gone through the adopted process at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, somethings about the system need to be amended for accountability and unbiased investigations into sexual violence allegations. This Evaluation of Existing Regulations is critical for protections of my fellow students and the next generation of college students. These students deserve a system that is unbiased, supportive, and just without being the \"the second rape\" or a further traumatizing process. Students should be able to trust faculty and staff that conduct these investigations and have confidence that their investigation is fair. \n\nMy recommendations:\n\n1. Title IX coordinators must be up to date on training for handling sexual assault and rape cases, so as to not ask re-victimizing questions such as \"Why did you wait so long to speak up?\" These trainings should be required once every 2 years to remain in a position of handling sexual assault cases. \n\n2. Any contact between the alleged assailant and victim during the investigation needs to be investigated for retaliation.\n\n3. The investigation and the report of its findings should be free of any bias, including the investigator's own bias. \n\n4. Any documentation that the investigator asks about in a transcribed or recorded interview should be included in the appendices of the investigative report. \n\n5. All documentation sent to the investigator regarding the case must be included in the final report to prevent bias. \n\n6. Persons not directly involved in the incident are prohibited from participating in any part of a formal hearing. Only witnesses and objective evidence should be allowed in the proceedings. \n\n7. If any evidence of or thought of bias is present, the investigator should recuse himself or herself from the investigation and have the case assigned to another investigator with which he will have no involvement. \n\nInvestigations regarding sexual assault should be conducted thoroughly, expediently, fairly, and without bias. I believe in the right for Title IX to protect all students regardless of sexual identity or citizen status. Students have the right to feel safe on campus and in their communities where they attend school. They have the right to protections and adjudication through the law and through Title IX. Students have a right to justice and safety on campus. Without these basic protections, any system, corrective or punitive, will have no credibility. \n\nI fully support Title IX and its current protections, but in my experience, they have not always been followed. Greater accountability for schools is needed and there is always room for improvement. The greater the accountability, the safer students are at school.","192":"To:\nHilary Malawer, Esq.\nAssistant General Counsel\nOffice of the General Counsel\nUnited States Department of Education\n\nFrom:\nJane Matusinec, mother of an adult son with Down Syndrome\n\nRe: I am commenting on Regulation ID: ED-2015-OSERS-001-1167, State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program; State Supported Employment Services Program; Limitations on Use of Sub-minimum Wage\n\nMy son Andrew is 26 years old, has Down Syndrome and currently works two days a week at Pantheon Industries in New Berlin, Wisconsin.  He does a variety of piecework jobs and absolutely loves it there.  They have a caring staff who work very hard to help Andrew be the best employee he can be. \n\n He began working at Pantheon while still in the 18-21 year old program at our local high school.  I am so grateful that he was able to continue on there after graduation. Being able to work at Pantheon, where he can work at the fastest pace he is able, is wonderful.  Andrew is very proud of his Pantheon paycheck no matter how big or small it is.  The dignity of work is more important.  Pantheon provides him employment that allows him to be the best he can be without judgment.  I can see him off to work knowing he is in a safe and caring environment.  The location is of utmost importance because in order for me to be able to keep my employment, I need him to work where he can easily get to and from his job.  The skills he developed at Pantheon helped him get a part-time job in a restaurant.  \n\nI am very concerned with any changes that would take away the choice of where people with disabilities can work. This definition been so narrowed, it does not do what Congress intended.  Indeed it is having the effect of making it harder for people with disabilities to find employment.  The Department should focus on expanding employment choice for people with disabilities, not further limiting it.  People with disabilities want and deserve choices. A definition that limits their employment options will not lead to further integration, but rather will reduce opportunities and cost people with disabilities jobs. \n\nThis definition of competitive integrated employment (34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)) should be eliminated and replaced with the definition in the WIOA statute until a broader, more expansive definition can be put in its place.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n","193":"PLEASE, I urge you, bring back parental consent and authority and withdraw the regulation that appears at 34 CFR Part 99, which was effective January 2012 and which greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA.

The guidance helps schools understand their duty to respond to sexual violence, and also, crucially, recognize that discrimination against transgender students is unlawful.\n\n    I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place, and to continue enforcing these protections so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive. \n\n    Respectfully,\n\nTammy Rainey\nRipley, MS\n","195":"I urge USED to withdraw the regulation that appears at  34CFR part 99 which became effective January, 2012.

I hope that before any rule is promulgated by Secretary DeVos' Department, she and her staff will take the time to educate themselves on the facts of campus sexual assaults and the requirements of due process. Secretary DeVos' suggested intentions to make it more difficult for women to come forward when they are sexually assaulted on campus, and more difficult to prove their allegations of being sexually assaulted by their classmates, acquaintances, or staff, denigrates women's constitutional equal standing under the law, and undermines their civil rights that Title IX is designed to protect. Creating additional barriers to sexual assault victims reporting, and proving, sexual assaults committed against them is a long step backwards, and simply emboldens those who would commit sexual assaults to act with impunity. \n\n(I have found no actual proposed rule promulgated by Secretary DeVos' Department related to Title IX and campus sexual assault investigations and hearings, only her demagoguery. My remarks cannot be specific to any yet-to-be promulgated rule.)\n\nAs a former prosecuting attorney, and a current lawyer for crime victims, I have some knowledge and experience that sexual assault is today a still-rampant crime of violence in the United States. Sexual assaults continue to plague school and college campuses. Men are the primary sexual assaulters. Women are the primary sexual assault victims. Most sexual assaults are not reported, out of shame, fear, and the procedural barriers put in place to disbelieve the victim. The consequences for a sexual assault victim can be devastating for a victim's psyche, health, education, and career prospects. \n\nDue process is the process that is due. For campus administrative disciplinary hearings, such as would be used to determine the facts and outcome of alleged violations of expected standards of conduct on a college or university campus, the required due process standards lawfully may be much lower than the high standards required for a criminal prosecution. Notice, an opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity for review, are elements that generally comport with the idea of due process. A preponderance of the evidence standard for weighing testimony and evidence, just as is used in general civil legal proceedings, suffices.\n\nIf there are colleges or universities who are not complying with the requirements of law, including Title IX, then the proper remedy is the Department of Education providing education and enforcement for those non-compliant institutions. Punishing sexual assault victims by raising the bar to have their allegations fairly heard is not a proper remedy. ","199":"Restore student's privacy !\n\nUSED, please with draw the regulation that appears at  34 CFR Part 99,  which was effective in January 2012 and which greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA.\n\nThank You,  ","200":"Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,\n\nI urge the Department of Education to put students first by maintaining all current guidance on Title II, Title VI, and Title IX in its current form and preserving 34 C.F.R. pts. 1 thru 1299.\n\nAs a survivor of sexual violence on campus, after I was raped, my worst fear was reaching out for help and being denied. The amount of courage that it took for me to report my rape to campus administrators was massive -- so when they were failing to follow their own rules and the Department of Education's guidelines in how they conducted my case, I felt re-traumatized all over again, and unsure of where to turn.\n\nThankfully, I had the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, and I knew that there were accountability mechanisms at the Department of Education to help me hold my school accountable. When I googled and read the letter, I realized that my school was denying me a fair process. So, I was able to point to the exact portions of the 2011 guidance that my university was failing to comply with, and by pointing it out to them and reminding them that they had a legal obligation to follow the guidance, I was able to access a fair process. They quickly fixed their wrongdoings and made corrections so that the remainder of my investigation would actually be prompt, equitable, and transparent. I would have never been able to advocate for myself and for my own civil rights without this critical guidance. \n\nTo eliminate the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter would decrease students' ability to understand the rights and fair processes they are due. Perhaps most important about the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is that my rapist also would have been able to do just as I did if he felt my university's failures were harming him as they were harming me. That is because the guidance provides equal protection for both parties, and it is focused on fairness. \n\nI agree that it is critical to address issues in the Title IX system, including the many flaws that have been ignored by this administration, flaws which further marginalize survivors, especially women of color, survivors with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. Many Title IX failings at institutions of higher education, the same failings that Secretary DeVos has cited, are supposed to be prevented by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter. It is clear to me that the issues in the Title IX process are enforcement issues -- not DCL issues. \n\nI ask that Secretary DeVos and Candice Jackson find a way to help schools enforce the guidance better, rather than eliminating it outright, and to be fair and balanced in their approach.

They sent a physical therapist and occupational therapist to our house to teach me specific exercises I could do with my child to help him recover from surgery and begin to gain strength in his muscles. They held us through those early months and then helped us get through yet another difficult time when my son needed a second brain surgery at age 3.

We have helped hundreds of students file cases with the Office for Civil Rights when their schools failed them. \n\nDespite Secretary DeVos' claim that the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is unclear and difficult to understand, what we have learned through our work on these cases is that not only do students understand the guidance issued by OCR but they have used it in a way to hold their schools accountable for the enforcement of their rights. \n\nTo eliminate the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter would directly harm students. \n\nWe further must acknowledge that rescinding any civil rights guidance or protections will disproportionately hurt already vulnerable and marginalized populations, including survivors. This is particularly important given the Department's responsibility to enforce Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  \n\nIf the Department of Education reduces the enforcement of students' civil rights -- the very laws and rights that the Department of Education has been tasked with enforcing -- women of color, students with disabilities, and folks within the LGBTQ community, whom are already at greater risk of sexual violence, yet whose experiences are underrepresented in policy, will be further harmed; these communities are both at risk for sexual violence and at risk for not being protected when they come forward.\n\nMoreover, to eliminate the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter or any other guidance in a manner that would change the standard of evidence in these cases would be to treat Title IX as an exception to civil rights' best practices. \n\nTherefore it is paramount that current guidance be not only upheld, but enforced by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. Rescinding such guidance only furthers inequity on our college campuses, and will not address the issues that Secretary DeVos has raised. \n\nWe strongly urge the Department to keep current guidance in place.

I'm not even sure that we would have known how to get him the services that he needed.  He has come so far from his initial diagnosis. Early Intervention took him from a child that could not walk, speak, or even want to touch anything, to a child that is thriving in all ways today.

Today, our 216 local associations in 47 states and the District of Columbia combine programming and advocacy to generate institutional change in the areas of racial justice and civil rights, empowerment and economic advancement of women and girls, and health and safety of women and girls. \n\nIn light of our mission and history, YWCA USA writes today in response to the June 22, 2017, Federal Register request for input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, to urge the U.S. Department of Education to maintain regulations and guidance that we believe are central to meeting its responsibility for protecting students from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and disability. \n\nDespite progress in many areas of life, too many of our young people continue to experience barriers to educational success. The Departments rules, regulations, policy guidance, data collection efforts, compliance reviews, and enforcement activities remain critical tools for ensuring that all students receive equal access to educational opportunity in safe and supportive learning environments. This is especially true for students who historically have been marginalized, including students who are African American, Latino, Asian American or Pacific Islander, Native American, immigrant, girls, LGBTQ, English learners, religious minorities, or who have a disability.\n\nYWCA is particularly concerned about the marginalization that girls of color historically have experienced, and that they continue to experience in Americas schools. As described more fully in our policy brief, On a Mission for Girls of Color: Inequality at School, many girls of color experience overly punitive disciplinary responses in public schools that are frequently under-funded, under-resourced, and increasingly segregated by race, ethnicity, and economic status. Such learning environments and the resulting academic achievement gaps that girls of color experience are illustrative of the ways in which they experience significant institutional and structural racism in Americas education system. \n\nTo address these and other concerns, YWCA urges the Department to maintain in full force and effect all regulations and guidance documents that seek to protect students from discrimination on the basis of race color, national origin, sex, and disability, as well as those that seek to improve the academic achievement of disadvantaged students. We are particularly concerned about the negative impact that repeal of the 2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students and the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX Requirements and How They Relate to Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence would have on students, and urge the Department to maintain these important guidance documents. \n\nAt a time of such rapidly shifting demographic changes, the Department should be affirming rather than paring back the tools and resources that have been developed to protect students from discrimination. Moreover, instead of repealing, replacing, or modifying regulations and guidance documents, the Department should further its commitment to racial and gender equity by bolstering support for the local level school system personnel who bear such important front-line implementation responsibilities. \n\nYWCA appreciates the opportunity to share our views with you. If you have any questions, please contact YWCA USA Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy Catherine Beane, at cbeane@ywca.org or 202-835-2354.\n\nSincerely, \n\nAlejandra Y. Castillo, CEO YWCA USA\n","213":"Please withdraw the regulation that appears at 34 CFR Part 99, which was effective January 2012. This greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA.

I understand that what is being attempted here, what is being proposed, seems straight forward, but this is a slap in the face to me in the rawest form. I take this so personally because the voices that are being heard the loudest right now in order for an action like this to even be entertained are the voices of perpetrators who feel as though they were falsely accused, while once again the voices of survivors like myself are being pushed aside. Research shows that it is in only the most rare cases that a claim about sexual violence is false. It also shows that college campuses harbor a \"season\" every year, if you will, that is labeled the \"red zone\" in order to indicate how the rates of sexual violence shoot up. I'm not writing to focus on the research that one should already be aware of if they are claiming to be educated on this topic, however. I'm writing to say that I personally faced a scenario in which my attacker had no idea what he was doing was wrong. While I was being assaulted, he seemed to be under the impression that I was \"into it,\" or at least that's what he said when I decided to report. See, it's not that survivors are lying about being assaulted, it's that perpetrators have no clue what counts as sexual assault. Despite the brutal questioning and victim blaming that I faced, and that I see at my job every day, my campus took action. How does a survivor prove trauma? What questions are going to be invasive enough to make it clear what happened? How will making it tougher to prove sexual assault help survivors that are too afraid to report in the first place for fear of the questioning and blame they will receive? Who has the right to change the standards of sexual assault action policies because they heard a few stories of some scorned perpetrators who felt as though their lives were ruined because they were actually held responsible for their actions? How many more ways can we interrogate survivors, how many more ways can we re-traumatize them every time a report is made, before you feel all those \"false reports\" will be weeded out? Don't do this.

ESSA should be repealed.  Not replaced, not revised, but repealed.  The regional centers directing the states to be sure Federal regulations should also be disbanded. There is no money for classrooms and schools because of the onerous Federal regulations and bureaucrats keeping track of what states 'should' be doing.

Self-Help is a two-time CE program grantee, leveraging $10.2 million in grant funds into more than $300 million in loans over a 14-year period, helping schools create or maintain more than 42,000 student spaces.  The program has been a cornerstone for our charter school lending program and a vital tool for reaching borrowers in low-income communities that struggle with low collateral values and narrow operating margins. Fully 95% of our lending in the program has reached schools that serve low-income students and communities. Department of Education staff have been supportive partners in this effort, and we appreciate this opportunity for input and improvement.\n\nWe have also signed on to the comments submitted by the Charter School Lenders' Coalition (CSLC), and our suggestions largely echo those combined concerns. Self-Help and the 13 other members of the CSLC share a concern for increasing the efficiency of the CE program without reducing the end benefits to charter schools and the children they serve.\n\nOur comments include the following:\n\n1) Set a Reasonable Grant Period End\nSection F.20 of the Guidance document provides the following definition: \"The grant period will run from the start date indicated on the grant award document until the Federal funds and earnings on those funds have been expended for the grant purposes or until financing facilitated by the grant has been retired, whichever is later.\"\n\nThis broad definition can cause the grant period to extend for decades, particularly for grantees like Self-Help that use the grant to back long-term debt and use the Reserve Account to guarantee additional debt as loans repay. Since the definition is in no way linked to performance goals, a grantee may have completed its initial grant period and far exceeded its financing and impact targets but remain subject to the same lengthy reporting requirements, including completion of the Annual Performance Report (APR), participation in quarterly monitoring calls, and time-consuming program audits. Self-Help, for example, is now four years beyond the original 10-year period of its 2003 CE grant and has more than tripled the $80 million lending goal. \n\nWe recommend that ongoing compliance and reporting instead be linked to the performance goals and time period formalized in the grant performance agreements. Compliance and reporting should conclude when all of the performance goals are achieved and the agreed-upon grant period has ended. At this point, the grantee has delivered on its contractual goals, greatly multiplied the impact of the grant dollars and maintained closely-monitored compliance over an extended period, demonstrating the ability to operate a long-term, high-impact charter school lending program.  We propose discussions with Department staff and charter school lending peers to explore ways in which these funds can be leveraged for maximum impact once the performance grant period hand s expired. \n\n2) Streamline Reporting Requirements\nThe Annual Performance Report excel spreadsheet currently requires the collection and reporting of 41 unique data points in separate fields for each school, with several fields requiring annual updates. We agree with our CSLC peers that the Department should conduct a comprehensive review to ensure the data collected is actually analyzed or used for a specific purpose or provides concrete value for compliance or program assessment.  We agree with the CSLC's list of reporting fields that can be modified or improved (below) and welcome further discussion on streamlining data collection: \n\nColumn C. Type of Transaction \n\nColumn H. Are then re any ongoing construction\/facilities projects at this school \n\nColumn I. How were grant funds used to secure or credit-enhance financing\n\nColumn J. Briefly Describe Source and Type of Financing\n\nColumn M. Amortization Structure(s)\n\nColumn N. Amortization Schedule(s)\n\nColumn P. Conversion Feature(s)\n\nColumn R.

Financed Amount Outstanding for this school \n\nColumn AL-AO. - Proficiency rates at school and state levels\n\nWe look forward to working with Department staff and our charter school lending peers to find improvements in the CE Program's regulations and operations.

If De Vos had actually taken any time to speak to survivors instead of making assumptions based on poorly informed societal stigma we wouldn't be in this position. I would love to educate her on why we need these protections because she clearly hasn't educated herself. If not for them, I couldn't have had my school place a mutual no contact order during the investigative process, not that it was even enforced. I would've had to wait longer to get ant closure that my school was not charging him for anything and was giving him two warnings for the two separate reports of sexually inappropriate and violent behavior he displayed. De Vos wants to make it easier for people to get away with things. I couldn't have a rape kit done because I wasn't raped in a way that would leave behind DNA evidence or was excessively violent enough to cause tearing. All I had was my word and even though our stories matched except for the dispute about whether or not there was consent, he still wasn't charged. Do you know how many assaults happen that don't leave behind DNA evidence? Really any physical evidence at all? How little survivors are believes despite showing signs of trauma and PTSD. Shame on De Vos for trying to silence more survivors and victims instead of opening up the discussion to learn from academic experts, those who work in the sexual violence field, and most importantly survivors themselves. How dare you excuse the violence happening to young women and men all over our country just because you've never experienced it and therefore can't relate to it. I would gladly tell anyone who would listen about my experiences and why we need a strong title IX instead of being silenced by society for daring to speak out about what makes them uncomfortable.","230":"\"Sports provide its participants with lifelong health, education and leadership benefits equally important to our daughters and our sons. I urge you to keep Title IX strong by preserving the current rules and enforcing this crucial legislation.\"","231":"I am writing to urge the Department of Education to uphold the protections and regulations provided by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter that allow colleges to appropriately address sexual violence on their campuses. While I write these comments as a private citizen, I have worked as a therapist and as an advocate for survivors of sexual violence for over five years both at a rape crisis center setting and in a campus setting at UC Berkeley. I am alarmed by how proposed changes will set our country back by silencing survivors and emboldening perpetrators of violence. \n\nThe Dear Colleague Letter has provided the necessary backing to equip colleges to intervene for their community's safety, empower survivors to pursue their educational goals, engage in effective violence prevention, and demonstrate a commitment to addressing and ending sexual violence on their campuses.\n\nColleges are uniquely situated to address its community, culture, and environment to bring an end to sexual violence. Colleges function as microcosms, and the injuries of sexual violence reverberates throughout an expansive community that can include social groups, families, dorms, academic programs, etc. It is essential for universities to be able to address situations where the complainant and respondent share classes or spaces to allow both parties to participate in their education while an investigation is carried out.\n\nPrior to these measures being put in place, I have worked with survivors who had been forced to stop attending classes, transfer schools, or drop out entirely in order to look after their own safety and health. Survivors need to be able to address sexual violence outside of the criminal justice system, and the Title IX process allows them to do so. For many survivors, justice is not about seeking out the prosecution or punishment of their perpetrator. Justice is being able to continue accessing education in the face of traumatic experiences they did not get to choose or control.\n\nProviding a mechanism for colleges to adjudicate incidents of sexual violence utilized the trauma-informed practice of offering survivors choices, which increases reporting overall. Relying solely on the criminal justice system or regional centers to address \"Title IX incident[s] which rises to a criminal level\" is shortsighted and will discourage survivors from coming forward to report.  The most effective way to increase reporting is to offer survivors options. When survivors understand the definitions of sexual violence and understand the school's resources and processes, they are nearly twice as likely to utilize such resources. \n\nSurvivors are often coping with the effects of trauma, which places them at a hindrance when trying to engage law enforcement. In the midst of acute trauma, a survivor's priority is to feel safe and okay, not to collect evidence and make a case for prosecution. Survivors are also required to use their financial resources to pay for expenses related to their assaults, such as their medical care, enrollment and withdrawal fees, counseling, housing, etc. This can create a disproportionate advantage for perpetrators who are able to invest their funds into their legal defense. The preponderance of evidence standard used by the Title IX process addresses these dynamics by placing an equal responsibility on all parties to present their case. The adjudication model adopted by universities also allows for trauma-informed approaches that are not available in the criminal justice system. \n\nImportantly, it must be noted that sexual harassment is a significant issue in colleges. Sexual harassment is not included in criminal codes and can only be addressed through civil remedies which are cost prohibitive and inaccessible to many survivors.\n\nCampuses need to prioritize primary prevention and culture change efforts to bring an end to violence. Using effective primary prevention strategies leads to fewer incidents of people perpetrating harm, and stronger intervention efforts by peers. The Dear Colleague Letter states that schools should \"implement preventive education programs and make victim resources, including comprehensive victim services, available.\" These efforts will ensure that all members of a university community know what values and norms exist on campus, how they may be held accountable for their actions, and how they can access support if they have been impacted by sexual violence.\n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter was vital in sending a message to university administrators and its community: colleges had a stake and a role in addressing sexual violence. Rescinding this letter will have the opposite effect. People who cause harm will know it will be easier to subvert accountability, law, and policy. Survivors who have experienced harm will hear that their trauma is their problem and their only remedy is to withdraw. Please protect our colleges and our communities by strengthening, not peeling back the progress we have made.","232":"I want to urge USED to withdraw the regulation that appears at 34 CFR Part 99, which was effective January 2012 and which greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA.

The strict interpretations of CIE and integrated settings have taken away work opportunities for people with disabilities. \n\nSection 511 of the WIOA is being interpreted differently from state to state.  It is always best practice to provide informed choice, but once a person with a disability looks at their options, it is then  their  right as a U.S. citizen to choose what is best for them.    When a person no longer has the right to choose where they work, who they spend their time with or where they   live, then overreach has occurred.  Youth 24 and younger are no longer able  to decide what services meet their needs.  With section 511,  youth now have a lengthy process that they must go through.  In the past the person could decide what they wanted and quickly enter into employment of their choice.  With WIOA, a person with a disability has to attempt employment for a \"reasonable\" amount of time before they can earn section 14 c wages.   Some have chosen to sit at home until they reach the age of 25.  This does not benefit the person, nor the family that supports them.  The focus needs to be given back to the individual to determine what best meets their needs.

Do not turn back the progress we have made on this issue","258":"Dear Secretary DeVos,\n\nI urge you to maintain and enforce all current Title IX rules and regulations, especially those that apply to athletics. Sports provide its participants with lifelong benefits (Staurowsky, 2015). Certainly, health is often improved when an individual participates, but there are other, often less tangible benefits that are earned through a sports experience. Benefits include leadership, workplace advancement, educational achievement, time management, and team work. It is in our best interest as a country to ensure that such benefits are extended equitably to the women of the United States. Now that we are decades into Title IX's implementation, we can see first-hand the strong women who have benefitted from a sports experience and gone on to become successful and contributing members of our society, including doctors, lawyers, politicians, and corporate leaders.\n\nIn 1971, a young girl in Connecticut sued for the right to join the boys' cross-country team, as her school did not have a team for girls. In his decision, the judge asserted, \"Athletic competition builds character in our boys. We do not need that kind of character in our girls, the women of tomorrow.\" (as cited in Blumenthal, 2005). Times have changed since that 1971 judicial decision. Our country is a better more prosperous place because women and girls can now access sports in our schools. In fact, labor economist Betsey Stevenson used Title IX as a natural experiment to examine the effect of Title IX on women's education and employment. The results are astounding and prove the need for all of our children to have \n\n\"High school athletics confer substantial economic benefits that last throughout participants' lives. When one compares people with similar educational opportunities, family backgrounds, measures of intelligence and self-esteem, the annual wages of former athletes are, on average, 7 percent higher than nonathletes. Similarly, athletes get almost half a year more education than nonathletes. The gains occur equally for girls and boys...In those states where Title IX led to the greatest expansion in female sports, the post-Title IX generation of women enjoyed more education, employment and higher wages than their pre-Title IX forebears. They were also more likely to enter previously male-dominated professions such as law, accounting and even sports.\"(Stevenson & Wolfers, 2012)\n\nThe passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 has prompted exponential growth in girls' and women's access to school sports opportunities. In 1971-72, girls received less than 300,000 high school sports opportunities and 30,000 collegiate sports opportunities (NFHS, 2016; NCAA, 2016). That number has since skyrocketed to more than 3.3 million participants in high school and nearly 215,000 participants in college (NFHS, 2016; NCAA, 2016). While there is pride to take in the progress made, we must not forget that inequities still persist. Though high school girls have made great strides, high school female athletes in 2015-16 have yet to reach the level of boys' pre-Title IX participation numbers and they lag behind their male counterparts in current participation rates by more than 1.2 million fewer opportunities (NFHS, 2016). However, this is not for lack of interest. Girls across the country have proven time and time again that they are interested in sports. In fact, girls' HS participation has increased every year since the 1988-89 school year (NFHS, 2016). Not only do participation inequities exist when looking at the country as a whole, we see that girls of color are doubly hit by race and gender. An analysis by the National Women's Law Center illustrates this disparity faced by girls of color, finding that heavily minority schools have fewer sports offerings than heavily white schools and 40 percent of heavily minority schools versus 16 percent of heavily white schools, have large gaps between girls' representation in student body versus their proportional representation in the athletic body. \n\nThe existing regulations of Title IX, including the three-part test for participation, ensure that our schools have concrete and tangible ways to comply with the law. These regulations are essential for ensuring we move towards equity and unleash the full potential of our children. Title IX has done great things for our society but inequities persist for our girls. The current rules and regulations of Title IX, paired with strong enforcement, is crucial to ensuring our country is able to fulfill its promise of an equitable educational experience for both our girls and our boys. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Axelson","259":"It saddens me to know we have to continue to fight...

We have enough racism and sexism in our educational institutions. Let's not go backward. Thank you.","262":"Dear Secretary DeVos,\n\nAs a student, the Title IX protections against sexual assault are incredibly important to my success in higher education, and the success of my peers. Having experienced an assault, I know how difficult it can be to continue to achieve academically when the very fact that I am on the same campus as my attacker causes me anxiety, and the mere incidence of walking past them (which at a small school can happen several times a day) quickly derails my ability to focus in class. If I am forced to interact with them through involvement in the same department, it can leave me feeling upset, unstable, and emotionally distressed for hours. Studying and completing schoolwork in this state is agonizing, if not impossible, and my teachers spoke to me with concern about my grades. Imagine trying to explain to your professor that you, normally an honors student, didn't do your homework although you had plenty of time to do so, because you spent hours of your nights and weekends crying and unable to move or eat because of what happened to you - that is the experience of a assault survivor. I was lucky enough that the incident I experienced was minor, but I can imagine how much worse it would be under different circumstances , and I hope this gives you a taste of empathy for the students your actions will affect.\n\nTitle IX ensures that students who report their assault are taken seriously by their university. It requires the institution to have a procedure for cases of sexual violence and take immediate action to provide a fair, formal hearing. In court, cases are often not processed for 2-4 years, by which time the victims has already failed or dropped out of university due to the stress and potentially continuing harassment. They should not have to have their education and the opportunity it provides ruined when someone else committed the crime! Title IX protects survivors of assault and makes sure they get supported and listened to. My university immediately provided resources and support, and I felt comforted to know that whatever came next, I had people behind me who would listen and help.\n\nSeveral of my friends have been sexually assaulted or harassed, and I know there are many more among the faces I know. Please do not take away these requirements. Please do not allow survivors to be ignored, brushed aside, or silenced by institutional interests. Please support proactive fair treatment and protect survivors rights to safe access to their education. We, as students, need these rules.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLillia","263":"My name is Elizabeth Marsh and I have a 7 year old daughter who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and has cognitive delays.

","265":"\nDear Secretary DeVos:\n\nFrom the testimony and interviews you have given, I gather that you believe strongly in providing taxpayer funds to schools owned by for-profit companies. You believe that such schools, relieved of the requirements and restrictions involved with being nonprofit or public, will yield better outcomes for students, directly and through competition. I assume this belief is genuine and not based on any past, present, or potential future financial motivation. \n\nI assume, further, that you believe that the real, substantive differences in how for-profit versus nonprofit entities are allowed to operate will yield significant differences in the behavior and decisions made by the schoolsd faith. An owners ability to personally capture any tuition funds not spent, for example, will cause that owner to make different decisions than if he was prohibited (as at a nonprofit school) from capturing those funds. That ability to profit from reducing costs could promote efficiencies that many people feel are elusive at nonprofit institutions.\n\nThe power of investor-owned business to promote innovation and efficiency, and to transform markets, is indeed impressive. \n\nPowerful, too, is private companies ability to take advantage of poorly designed government programs. The current design of federal higher education vouchersPell Grants and student loanshas a number of characteristics that have led to abuses. The funds can pay for tuition as well as living expenses, but institutions are free to take the entire amount in tuition, leaving nothing for the costs that a student must face if attending school full-time. The tuition level itself is not required to have any mooring whatsoever to a market price, which creates an invitation to overcharge and under-deliver. Meanwhile, the fact that the federal government is providing the aid sends a very strong message to students that your agency endorses the product they are getting, or at least that students can expect to receive a reasonable return on their and the American taxpayers educational investment.  \n\nWhen a school gets most of its revenue from government vouchers, the government is the customer who should be paying attention to whether it is getting value for the money. Yet in the case of federal college aid, the government is assumingwronglythat the students are playing the role of wise shoppers. Low-income students and veterans in particular rely on  the government to perform that role. As a result of this mismatch, schools can easily overcharge and under-deliver. These problems caused by federal aid lie atop the information asymmetrythe unusual nature of education as a product\/servicethat makes for-profit schools more hazardous even in the absence of government vouchers. \n\nI bring up these issues in the context of a regulation-reduction request because the unique characteristics of for-profit companies, combined with the design of the Title IV program, prompted the creation of many of the regulations that schools complain about. The federal micromanaging of accreditation is almost entirely a result of the design of Title IV in the context of for-profit providers. So too are the complicated refund requirements (R2T4). The same goes for the state authorization requirements, and even the gainful employment and borrower defense rules.\n\nOne way to relieve institutions of the regulatory burden, while improving the treatment of taxpayers and students, would be to exempt institutions that can demonstrate that their assets and revenues are under the control of people without a financial interest in the institution, since those restrictions at public and nonprofit institutions have been shown to largely prevent the abuses. \n\nIn addition, or alternatively, you could consider embracing your own theory about the power of the market and require a demonstration of market viability without federal aid. Recently we have seen a number of coding bootcamps, not financed by federal aid, go out of business, while others have grown. That shake-out is a useful market dynamic that largely does not function in federally funded for-profit schools because of the design of the aid program. If you believe in the power of markets, then consider inserting a market viability requirement into the design of the programs you manage. It might make other regulations less necessary.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Shireman\n","266":"These 509 constituents representing California join with the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in urging the U.S. Department of Education to protect Title IX, preserve all of its current regulations and guidance, and fully enforce the law. \n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.

Over the last year, I have personally spent hours tracking down guardians to attend informed choice and career counseling meetings.  I know VRS contracted with local CILS to perform these meetings, but there has been no reimbursement for providers for all the time and energy they have put into getting the guardians to these meetings.  In addition to this, it is not your entry level staff coordinating the guardian's attendance, but rather supervisor level staff making the arrangements which cost providers even more money in staff wages.  I would recommend that these meetings should be completed at annual meetings and should be able to be completed electronically so guardians do not have to schedule separate meeting times.\n\nOver the last year, post-graduation options for 2017 graduates have been restricted.  There have been many guardians upset that their children or loved ones could not work in center-based employment and instead, the child needed to go through strenuous evaluations in community locations only to find out that they were not capable of achieving employment goals in the first place.  This has caused unnecessary hardship on student's emotional health as they now feel like a \"failure\", and it has caused unnecessary financial hardships on families as these students had nowhere else to go so the parents had to skip work and stay home with their child.  There are still many 2017 graduates without services because they are still trying to get VRS evaluations completed.  I would recommend that there be at least a year post-graduation where graduates could participate in center-based employment options while they are participating in VRS evaluations.  Once the VRS evaluation is complete, the individual either stops working in center if they are found to have the skills needed to achieve competitive integrated employment or they are able to continue working as they have been in center based employment.\n\nAs for the required annual career counseling meetings, we have had many parents complain of the burden it is to have an additional meeting that only lasts 15 minutes when they already know that their loved one is not interested in pursuing competitive, integrated employment.  Moving into the second year of these meetings, we have had additional complaints and great reluctance from guardians about the fact that they need to attend these meetings annually.  I would suggest that if a guardian says \"no, they are not interested in competitive, integrated employment at this time\" they would not need to attend another meeting for at least three years.  \n\nLastly, the implementation of WIOA and Section 511 was rather chaotic, with very little direction from the federal government.  For the first few months, VRS and CILS had very little knowledge of what they were to be doing.  This did smooth out over the course of the year, but I would recommend a longer transition period for agencies to have the time to create an actual plan for implementation after they truly understood the regulations within WIOA.\n","268":"These 509 constituents representing California join with the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in urging the U.S. Department of Education to protect Title IX, preserve all of its current regulations and guidance, and fully enforce the law. \n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.

People with disabilities, \neven those with the most significant barriers to employment, should be permitted to choose work whenever desired and\npossible.

Following are our recommendations.\n\n34 CFR 361.48(a) Allowable expenditures under pre-employment transition services.\n\nNebraska VR recommends that the interpretation of this regulation be modified to allow for the provision of any necessary supports for a student with a disability participating in pre-employment transition services to count as an allowable expenditure under the 15% set aside. \n\nIn order to provide students with disabilities the opportunity to participate in some of the required pre-employment transition services, it is necessary to provide transportation, job coaching, assistive technology, and other support services. For example, the majority of the costs of providing a work based learning experience are the provision of these supports. The impact of such a narrow interpretation is to further shift case service dollars to students with disabilities resulting in a mandated set aside much greater than the 15% requirement and increasing the administrative burden on states for tracking and reporting. The long term likely outcome of this restrictive interpretation leads to states going into an order of selection due to the lack of case service funds for students and adults while unfortunately returning the earmarked dollars for pre-employment transition services due to an inability to fully expend them. \n\nAdditional interpretations of the status of pre-employment transition students who are required to apply for, become eligible, and access supports under the regular VR program, when the state VR program is in an order of selection, will eventually result in fewer students being able to benefit from such services due to the inability to access supports while waiting in an order of selection. This is the opposite of what we believe was intended when Congress mandated an increased focus on serving students with disabilities!\n\nWe believe the language in the law could be interpreted in another way that would actually enhance the opportunities for students with disabilities to benefit from the changes due to WIOA. Regarding pre-employment transition services, the statement \"Funds available under subsection(a) shall be used to make available.....\" could be interpreted to mean that any services and supports contributing to the availability of the required pre-employment transition services are in fact necessary to \"making them available\" and thus an eligible pre-employment transition service expenditure.A broader interpretation would actually be in line with the intent of Congress to provide more opportunities for participation in pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities. \n\n2. 2 CFR 200.313 and 439 requiring that state Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies must have prior approval from the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) prior to making equipment purchases of $5,000 or more. \n\nNebraska VR recommends that this regulation be revised to waive the pre-approval requirement for equipment or capital expenditures purchased for the benefit of Vocational Rehabilitation consumers. The requirement places an unnecessary administrative burden on programs and will significantly delay the provision of services due to waiting for approvals from someone at a level with no understanding of the case requiring duplication of information and redundancy in responsibilities that are unwarranted. Additionally, the requirements are in conflict with the assurances of service without delay required by 34 CFR 361.36(b) and the flexible procurement policies required by 34 CFR 361.52(b)(3).\n\n","283":"Title IX has done great things for our society but inequities persist for our girls.

Student survivors should not have to choose between their right to an education and their right to be safe. When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. We support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n \nAll Students deserve a right to an education free from discrimination \nOur education system has a long and troubled history of being unfair to too many students and communities. Title IX and other anti-discrimination laws protect students who identify as young women,  LGBTQ, Black, Latinx, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, or students with disabilities. These students regularly face too many barriers to educational success. We believe the guidance issued by the Obama administration provides an essential baseline of protection that should not be diminished.

We support the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter precisely because it ensured that all students, both victims and those accused, would have access to due process. The DCL affirmed students rights to a fair and just system by outlining steps that schools should take to respond to gender-based violence while ensuring due process such as: \n- Hiring a Title IX coordinator;\n- Implementing and distributing the grievance procedures for filing complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination;\n- Providing \"adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints, including the opportunity for both parties to present \n  witnesses and other evidence;\"\n- Allowing both parties timely and equitable access to any information that will be used at a hearing; \n- Allowing both parties equal access to legal representation;\n- Allowing both parties access to appeal any final decision;\n- Requiring University staff involved in these proceedings to have training, and experience in handling complaints for sexual \n  harassment and sexual violence.\n \nThe Department of Education is entrusted with the important goal of providing high-quality education to all students.

USDOE to direct RSA to rescind the FAQs and place primacy on the actual language contained in the federal WIOA statute as it relates to whether a job meets the definition of competitive-integrated employment. Duly promulgated statute and regulation places authority with the vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselor to make a professional judgment about whether a job meets the definition of competitive-integrated employment, especially as it relates to the question of \"integrated\". The FAQs, on the other hand, include limitations that go beyond the statutory and regulatory definition of competitive-integrated employment. The VR counselor (many [or all] of whom in Pennsylvania hold a Master's Degree in Rehabilitation Counseling) is in the best position to make the judgment - on an individualized basis - and should not exclude employers or groups of employers based simply on an FAQ document that was not duly promulgated as a regulation or passed by Congress as a statute. Employment opportunities that pay minimum wage or higher and meet the integration test contemplated by Congress are being excluded merely due to the whim of federal bureaucrats. \n2. Section 511 Interpretation. RCPA encourages the USDOE to direct RSA to issue guidance to Designated State Units (DSUs) for vocational rehabilitation to treat adults with intellectual disabilities of any age the same as any other vocational rehabilitation customer by closing their case and\/or making an ineligibility determination when the individual, after being referred to the DSU and receiving information about what it has to offer, makes an informed decision to not accept additional vocational rehabilitation services. Adult men and women with intellectual disabilities must be given the dignity and respect of having their decisions about their own life honored. \n3. DSU data collection requirements. RCPA supports requirements for DSUs to collect relevant data on outcomes and services provided, but we are concerned that there are too many new data collection requirements imposed on DSUs that they are having to place excessive amounts of time, energy, and funding on data collection and reporting rather than emphasizing customer services and outcomes. \n4.Pre-Employment Transition Services (P.E.T.S.).  \na. Group Counseling. RSA's policy of making DSUs exclude any student who does not have a documented disability from group P.E.T.S. counseling is unnecessary, backward, and excessive. First, it is reminiscent of segregated training for students with disabilities. Second, WIOA requires DSUs to provide P.E.T.S. to students who are \"potentially eligible.\" Yet, RSA is requiring DSUs to exclude any student from group counseling without a documented disability, and furthermore it is requiring DSUs to document names of participants in the training and secure parental permission before participating. These limitations and requirements place a chilling effect on student engagement and denies students valuable information about a service that could help them get or keep a job. \nb. Transportation.  RSA policy has led to DSUs believing they are not allowed to permit students from utilizing transportation as a form of work readiness training, as part of a job exploration plan, or as a way to develop self-advocacy skills. Transportation is foundational to getting and keeping a job, yet RSA rules say no. This must be reversed. The US Department of Education should direct RSA to become more creative and find ways to say \"yes\" to needed services rather than always find a way to say \"no.\"\nc. Assistive Technology (AT).  RSA's prohibition on AT is similarly backward and unfortunate relative to its transportation policy. AT gives students with disabilities opportunities to pursue job exploration, develop job-readiness skills, and succeed during work-based learning experiences. RSA should encourage DSUs to find innovative ways to incorporate AT into P.E.T.S., not prohibit it.  \n5. The USDOE should direct its OSERS to require, as a condition of accepting federal IDEA funding, state education agencies to find a way that would allow a parental consent document to be applicable for both education and vocational rehabilitation services at the state and local level for students with disabilities. LEAs believe they are prohibited by law to share student information with vocational rehabilitation offices (under the jurisdiction of the DSU) without a separately signed release from the parent, yet this duplicative system does little else but cause frustration and administrative burden.  At the very least, the OSERS should develop a model agreement that state education agencies and DSUs could consider signing that would allow information about students with disabilities to be shared between LEAs and local vocational rehabilitation offices in a timely, protected, and confidential manner without risking a violation of law.\n","309":"All I can say is that repealing guidelines on Title IX would be a travesty.

Thomas Jefferson was a founding father and served as president from 1801-1809. He was a proponent of both Democracy and Republicanism as well as Libertarian principles of individualism. This is probably because America was founded as a Constitutional Republic, not a democracy which Thomas Jefferson signed! Thomas Jefferson was also a slave owner which seems to contradict his liberal stance in ending slavery. The Republican party was formed in 1854 as an opposition party to slavery. If you look at what parties supported the abolition of slavery, it is the Republican Party that supported it, not the Democrats. In 1868 the 14th Amendment (full citizenship to free slaves) was passed with 94% of Republican support and 0% of Democratic support. The 15th Amendment (Right to vote for all men) was passed in 1870 with 100% of republican support and 0% from Democrats. AND the KKK was originally formed as an extension of the Southern Democratic Party! You see a pattern yet? In 1964 the Civil Rights Act was passed with with 80% support from the republicans and 63% support from the democrats. Another note worthy fact is that the first 21 African American congressmen appointed were all Republicans.  It took Democrats until 1935 to elect their first African American congressman. In the Senate the first African American Republican to serve was in the year 1870, for the Democrats it wasn't until 1993!  Oh and remember Democratic Senator Robert Byrd? He was a member of the KKK... unreal! It's almost like Democrats like racism??????!\n\nIt is not simply Republicanism that is an issue today.

And every year, you know how many people take that chance? None. \n\nThe Lighthouse pays competitive wages (at or above minimum wage), full benefits, sick and vacation leave, and a retirement plan. They have people who have been employed there thirty, forty, even fifty years. People who are grateful to come to work every day and do the jobs they love.\n\nSo why are new government regulations threatening these jobs for hard-working Americans?\n\nThere are some who say AbilityOne jobs are outdated. In some respects, that may be true. Our economy is shifting away from manufacturing towards jobs in technology. And AbilityOne agencies are going to need to continue to adapt to an evolving marketplace. But one sad fact remains just as true today as when the AbilityOne program was created over 75 years ago: 70% of people who are blind are unemployed. \n\nIf jobs at AbilityOne agencies are no longer considered successful employment outcomes by state rehabilitation agencies, where will those people who are blind go for work?\n\nLets not limit choice and jobs for people who are blind by discounting AbilityOne jobs. Please consider revoking regulations from the Department of Education that deem AbilityOne jobs as not offering competitive integrated employment. \n\nSincerely,\nElder Gwin\nMember, Board of Directors\nLighthouse Louisiana\n","313":"Dear Secretary DeVos:\n\nI'm writing to ask that you maintain the Departments 2011 and 2014 Sexual Violence guidance that explains a Schools responsibility to respond effectively to sexual violence against students in accordance with the requirements of Title IX.  \n\nLGBTQ students face a disproportionate risk of sexual assault. At a time when schools already struggle to respond to sexual assault on their campuses, removing the guidance will make it harder for LGBTQ survivors to get the resources and support they need. \n\nThe guidance is also particularly important for protecting the rights of transgender students on campus. As someone who went to school with several transgender friends, I've seen firsthand how important these kinds of guidelines are when dealing with staff and administrators who might not have a very deep understanding of the challenges that face trans students.\n\nI urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place, and to continue enforcing these protections so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive. \n\nSincerely,\nKatherine Casey\n","314":"Accrediting Agency Oversight:\n\nAccrediting agencies should be given full authority over curricular design, outcomes, and consumer information compliance enforcement as part of each accrediting agency's unique perspective and process.  The established accreditation process exists for the dual purpose of evaluating the quality of higher education for improvement and to determine institutional eligibility for federal funding from ED.  Accreditation is a peer-reviewed process that should be strengthened by freeing accreditors to exercise authority in areas involving both academics and outcomes as part of their institutional review processes.  ED and the Executive Branch have attempted numerous times to evaluate outcomes only to fail at accounting for variables and complexities that have always existed in the higher education industry as well as differences between sectors within higher education.  Accrediting agencies are far better equipped to produce accurate and efficient results in this area.  The review process and authority needs to remain completely with the regional accreditors. \n\nStudent Loan Indebtedness:\n\nColleges and universities should be empowered to lower overall student loan indebtedness based on academic program, cost of attendance, and student risk factor criteria.  A multi-pronged approach to lower excessive student loan borrowing is needed as national student loan debt is rising to new levels.  Colleges and universities need flexibility to appropriately adjust loan levels to match educational program levels.  Additionally, institutions need flexibility to adjust Cost of Attendance (COA) calculations and COA components to ensure that borrowing levels are adequate and appropriate to specific educational programs.","315":"ED Continued Regulatory Review:\n\nRegulations enacted in recent years should continue to be reviewed by higher education stakeholders beyond the regular review of the Higher Education Act by Congress that seeks to eliminate previously burdensome regulations.  Specific actions should include reconsideration of the negotiated rulemaking process.  The current process has proven to be sub-optimal because ED implements new regulations using a process that excludes stakeholders and bundles issues into binary decision points while also regularly issuing guidance that is burdensome and contradictory to other ED guidance.  As a result, ED is placed in a position of undue power by default.  Beyond this round of review, there should be continued review of regulations issued prior to January 20, 2017 including, but not limited to, burdensome regulations issued effective October 29, 2010, Return to Title IV requirements, verification requirements, and restoration of previously eliminated safe harbor allowances. See Federal Register Volume 75, Number 209, pages 66831-66975 related to ED 34 CFR Parts 600, 602, 603 et. al \"Program Integrity Issues, Final Rule.\"  Additionally, the outcomes of this review should be specific and measured by whether ED has improved timeliness (as requested by many stakeholders, including NASFAA) and lowered costs from streamlining ED focus and staffing as well as redeployment of the Data Retrieval Tool and proven simplification of the FAFSA to the extent that it does not trigger state level aid applications and complexities.\n \nState Authorization Requirements:\n\nED has recently pressured states to increase regulatory requirements and burdens on institutions of higher education in contradiction to the Department's previous stance of accepting state autonomy on these matters.  In October 2010, regulations were established to provide guidance on the minimum requirements for State authorization, but the guidance did not address additional locations, branch campuses, distance education, or correspondence courses until more recent regulations were released on December 16, 2016 with an effective date of July 1, 2018. Although the final rule remains largely unchanged, the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) verbiage created widespread confusion of the Department's intentions regarding reciprocity agreements.  In Section 600.2, it states that a reciprocity agreement \"does not prohibit a participating State from enforcing its own consumer protection laws\".  The Department has since clarified that this Section was not intended to permit State consumer protection laws to be stacked on top of a reciprocity agreement.  Nonetheless, the Department should add an addendum to Section 600.2 to avoid future conflicting interpretations.  States and institutions that opt in to an approved State authorization reciprocity agreement are already responsible for uniform consumer disclosure notifications and a proper complaint resolution process.  Thus, a separate act by the State to enforce its own consumer protection laws is an overreach.  The ability for a State to enforce its own laws in addition to the provisions of a reciprocity agreement would create unnecessary confusion for students and institutions alike, and with respect to the proper approval procedure, it has the potential to increase costs and lengthen the approval process.  In addition, many institutions and organizations agree with the recommendation to remove federal oversight of the entire state authorization process as doing so would reduce excess administrative burden and promote the availability of more affordable and accessible higher education.  The federal role in state approvals and authorizations process should be eliminated.  Remove the July 1, 2018 set of regulations to allow states to retain the ability to enforce their own requirements.  ED oversight in this area is cumbersome and unnecessary.

Additional guidance published by the U.S. Department of Education, especially in the last 3 years, has dramatically expanded the definition of what may constitute a \"third-party servicer.\"  This expansion was, in part, spurred by at least one bad-actor institution, but its implications will be felt across several thousand colleges and universities.  Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education has issued unclear guidance that has caused confusion.  It attempted to remedy the earlier guidance with additional unclear guidance.  Schools seeking clarification have been met with opposite and conflicting answers between the Third-Party Oversight Group of ED and the School Eligibility Channel, Integrated Partner Management Group of ED.  In fact, Third-Party Oversight Group staff, when unable to answer basic questions regarding the scope of the guidance, responded with sweeping suggestions such as submitting all contracts for their review.  ED has also shown a lack of understanding of the complexity of integrated information systems and an unwillingness to clarify definitions to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden.  Thus, ED should eliminate recent extraneous and confusing guidance on Third Party Servicer with a goal to replace it with clarification of an older regulation, 34 CFR 668.25.  The guidance on Third Party Services published during the last three years should be rescinded, in particular, Dear Colleague Letter GEN-12-06, Dear Colleague Letter GEN-12-08, Dear Colleague Letter GEN-15-01, and Third-Party Servicer Q & A. Specifically, we request to exclude from the definition of \"confirm\" any held data or automated calculation of data from which a calculation occurs when that method was disclosed to the school.  Please note 34 CFR 668.25 - \"(i) Confirm the eligibility of the student before making that disbursement or delivering those proceeds. This confirmation must include, but is not limited to, any applicable information contained in the records required under...\"  Alternatively, ED should return back to the original definition in 34 CFR 668.14 (18) (I - iii B).\n\nFraud Enforcement - ED and OIG:\n \nA nationwide, uniform, and one-record system to properly track Title IV fraud, with integrated state and local law enforcement measures, should be deployed immediately.  The relevant authorities should examine the possibility of leveraging existing federal systems or developing a new system to house cases of potential student aid fraud and stolen identity accounts.  Both ED and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) have failed to adequately enforce anti-fraud measures related to Title IV, especially with regard to fake student fraud rings, school hoppers, and identity theft scenarios.  While ED has implemented some measures like the Unusual Enrollment Hold (UEH) process, a significant amount of identified potential fraud is being ignored as both ED and the OIG are overwhelmed.  This failure is costing taxpayers tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in falsified Title IV financial aid disbursements.  Proper enforcement does not need to catch every offender so long as it presents a chilling effect to the Title IV fraud industry and provides immediate financial benefits to ED and the taxpayers.  The OIG needs a system in which it can better coordinate with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce existing laws and hinder growing student financial aid waste, fraud, and abuse, thereby resulting in more convictions of criminals and greater savings to taxpayers.  An examination of leveraging existing federal systems, or developing a new system, to house data on potential student aid fraud and stolen identity accounts is necessary.  This is in accordance with the OIG's stated intention to \"establish data analytic processes to detect electronic fraud activities such as student aid fraud rings and identity theft within the Federal student aid arena\" (OIG Annual Workbook, FY17).","318":"September 20, 2017\n\nHilary Malawer\nAssistant General Counsel\nOffice of the General Counsel\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Avenue SW., Room 6E231\nWashington, DC 20202\n\nAgency Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\n\nIn response to requests for comments pertaining to Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,\" the following comments are submitted to Secretary DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for consideration.\n\nBorrower Defense to Repayment:\n\nBorrower Defense to Repayment regulations and guidance should be completely rescinded because previous and fully adequate avenues of enforcement already existed.  To restore due process, reduce overregulation and unnecessary overreach, and provide students with an effective means to bring allegations of abuse from schools, a repeal of the current Borrower Defense regulations is in order.  In 2013, ED began to expand its scrutiny of federal aid disbursing institutions, primarily in the for-profit sector, to ensure students were not being lured by bad-actor institutions who promoted false job statistics, inflated graduation and completion rates, and used predatory recruiting practices.  ED originally sought, but inadequately handled, suspension of federal aid eligibility for institutions like Corinthian College with thousands of students seeking student loan discharges.  ED's actions were applied unnecessarily broadly to all Title IV eligible institutions. Institutions that had no evidence of breaking the law or deceiving students are now mandated to comply with the burdensome regulations beginning July 2017.  In 2016, ED proceeded to expand its oversight through new Borrower Defense regulations which strip away an institution's ability to obtain due process and provided no opportunity to appeal allegations with ED.  In addition, the current Borrower Defense regulations virtually eliminate the legal requirement that a party bringing an allegation bear the burden of proof, likely to result in many frivolous claims from borrowers seeking debt relief.  Further, ED failed to grasp other far-reaching implications of this regulatory burden, including a likely radical and costly change in minimum record-keeping requirements for institutions.\n\nGainful Employment:\n\nGainful Employment Regulations and Guidance, as well as duplicate and excessive consumer information regulations and guidance, should be completely rescinded with authority placed back into the hands of regional accreditors.  In July of 2011, ED enacted Gainful Employment regulations to ensure that select programs were preparing students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.  The most recent amendments, effective July 2015, have created unnecessary and burdensome reporting responsibilities and disclosure requirements for all sectors because of the demise of a few for-profit institutions.  ED needs to eliminate duplicative reporting and disclosure requirements among all Title IV processes for the sake of efficiency, the accuracy of data, and the overall reduction of administrative burden, which also contributes to the increased cost of higher education.  Institutions of higher education already report graduation rates through various avenues including, but not limited to, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) by way of the College Navigator, state reporting, accrediting bodies, government websites, College Scorecard, Net Price Calculator, and the Federal Shopping Sheet. In addition, separate calculations and databases are being used to upload and report this data to ensure its reliability.  As a point of reference, there are over 20 pages of reporting and disclosure requirements referenced in the Federal Student Aid Handbook.  On the other hand, ED has failed to properly handle the Gainful Employment data provided to it on more than one occasion, bringing into question the value of these regulations.  The collection of the data itself, for colleges and universities, is burdensome and incomplete in its present form.  Additionally, the Gainful Employment requirements were expanded to private institutions in non-degree program areas with no bad-actor justification.  This overreach exists in other sectors, as well.","319":"Don't take  this regulation away ! \nOur children need this help.","320":"Please do not limit job opportunities and choices for those with disabilities.\n\nThe DOE should focus on expanding choice for those with disabilities not further limiting it.\n\nOur son has a permanent disability from birth, but he loves people and he wants to work.

I am a  long-time Department of Education executive and Civil Rights Attorney.  In 1983 as a policy attorney I wrote the first internal guidance on sexual harassment for our Enforcement Offices.  The term sexual harassment was new at that time and has become more understood with the passage of time. As Director of Policy in OCR I also developed and  implemented the policies on investigating racial and disability harassment. In light of increased shining the light on bullying and harassment in schools and colleges, I am proud to have worked to protect students from bullying and harassment through these important policy and regulatory initiatives. \nIt is ironic that the original purpose of the Department of Education's call for public comments was to reduce the number of federal regulations.It now appears that you want to add a federal Title IX regulation instead of continuing to provide assistance to schools to improve their compliance with the current importantlegally justified Title IX guidance. Title IX guidance related to sexual harassment and violence, Title IX Coordinators, and many other topics helps students, parents, and educators know their rights and responsibilities to end sex discrimination in education.\nIn your September 7, 2017 remarks you called the OCR sexual harassment and violence guidance a failed system. You said it has generated hundreds of OCR cases. Instead of failing, many consider the increased reporting of sexual harassment and assault as an indicator of success. There is evidence that having good clear guidance encourages people to report sexual abuse and to work with Title IX Coordinators and others on their campus who may help them. Others see this OCR 2011 and 2014 guidance as a useful framework to develop their own institutions procedures and systems that they continually improve as students and others deal with and try to prevent, sexual misconduct. On many campuses there is evidence that this OCR guidance has helped generate a better understanding of how to create safer and more equitable school climates.  Schools and colleges should through education and administration programs assume responsibility for protecting their students from sexual harassment and sexual violence.\nInstead of revising these guidance documents, I encourage the US Department of Education to provide positive incentives and assistance to education institutions from pre-K to adult education to pay more attention to the use of these OCR guidelines.  ED should also stop planning to change these guidance documents into less flexible regulations. The current OCR and DOJ guidance documents already allow the educational institutions sufficient flexibility in how they can best be implemented in their unique institutions.\nIn summary, I hope you will recognize that the current Title IX guidance documents related to sexual harassment and violence have a strong emphasis on educational institutions responsibility to providerecipients protection from sexual harassment and violence as well as fair procedures for all involved including those accused. Many believe that what is needed most from the Department of Education is technical assistance and more training for school administrators, students, and others on using all existing OCR guidance documents and related resources in the most effective way in each education institution from pre-K to adult education. I therefore oppose activities by you and others in this administration to repeal, replace, or weaken any of the Title IX guidance documents.","335":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

We believe that the calculation of this score needs to be modified, as the DoEd interpretation of the accounting calculations are flawed in many instances, and changes in FASB accounting standards that are required to be adopted by 2019 will make it impossible to calculate the score as it is currently defined.\nTwo specific examples of flawed interpretation include the following:\n1. The classification of defined benefit pension liabilities in the calculation of the primary reserve ratio.\nThe Department's view regarding defined benefit pension liabilities was outlined in a letter from Robin Minor, Chief Compliance Officer, on September 1, 2010 to Anne Gross, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs at the National Association of College and University Business Officers.\nThe liability for a defined benefit retirement plan, is long term in nature, in that the liability will be paid out over the lifetime of current and future retirees.  While there may be a de minimis contribution by active participants prior to retirement, the employer is responsible to make payments to defined benefit retirement plans to maintain adequate funding for payment of current and future benefits to retirees over their respective lifetimes.  An employer is not required to fund the liability in its entirety in any one year. Post-retirement healthcare benefit and defined benefit pension liabilities are similar in nature in that at the end of any given fiscal year, both represent a long term obligation to be paid out for the benefit of retirees over their respective lifetimes. The primary reserve calculation should factor out both liabilities, not just the post-retirement healthcare, because of their similar characteristics. \nIn addition, employers with defined benefit plans are required to insure them against insolvency through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, an independent agency of the United States government created by the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974 (ERISA.)  Accordingly, satisfaction of a defined benefit plan pension liability is ultimately guaranteed by the Federal Government.\n\n2.  The classification of accumulated endowment gains as term endowments.\nSecond, we believe the Department is in error in their the application  of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Staff Position 117-1, Endowments of Not for Profit Organizations: Net Asset Classification of Funds Subjected to an Enacted Version of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA).  DoED staff have interpreted this adoption to mean that true endowments are term endowments and not expendable.  The reclassification of true endowments to temporarily restricted net assets (per FSP 117-1) did not make the endowment any less spendable.\n\nPrior to the adoption of FSP 117-1 schools classified, in accordance with the then existing accounting guidance, the income and appreciation from donor restricted funds as unrestricted net assets. The adoption of FSP 117-1, was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The effect of the change was to reclassify from unrestricted net assets to temporarily restricted net assets to give effect to the implied time restriction imposed by FSP 117-1.\n\nTo our knowledge, DoEd has not issued a formal position nor interpretive guidance around FAS 117-1 or UPMIFA. Instead, there has been no rulemaking or requests for public comments regarding the application of FAS 117-1 or UPMIFA. In our opinion, this results in outcomes that are arbitrary in nature, and not based on the sort of notice and discussion that should apply to a federal rule.\n\nThus, as circumstances (i.e., UPMIFA, accounting rules, and the legal rules) evolve, especially in the case of the new financial reporting requirements to be adopted in 2019, providing greater flexibility to address potential challenging financial issues, DoEd must do the same. \n\nWe thank you for your consideration. We understand the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities Financial Responsibility Task Force has also raised these issues in its November 2012 report.  Please let us know if we can provide further clarification.\n\nVirginia C.

Unfortunately, we know all too well that we can not trust every administrator, every school, every coach, every athlete, every fraternity or every student... to hold the humanity and worth of our all of our girls sacred and equal, but we do know that having clear federal policy in place can and will in the face of hate and sexism.  \n\nIt is my sincere hope that the protection of the rights of women and girls in schools and on college campuses across the country is not considered one of those \"unnecessary regulatory burdens on the American people\" that this effort is attempting to alleviate from us.  \n\n","347":"please don't cut this program.

We are main artery, a lifeline, for our region and surrounding countiesand our agency and its blind employees' are being eliminated from services because WIOA regulations now considers our agency a non-competitive and integrated employment placement. \n\nBlind workers in both our main office, Base Supply Centers, and in Production and Assembly are put at a disadvantage and unable to maintain employment when preforming their daily job duties and responsibilities because of lack of supported employment because of the Workforce Innovations and Opportunities Act (WIOA). As a result, VR agencies have immediately closed blind employees' vocational rehabilitation cases and supports such as assistive technology, software, hardware, orientation and mobility, and transportation have been cut off because of WIOA. \n\nAs an agency that works in partnership with a  state VR agency to provide competitive and integrated  employment (CIE)this is because of our affiliation as an AbilityOne program and NIB agency.

There is a national credential for interveners which can set the standard for who provides this service. The field has developed tools to help educational teams determine which students should have an intervener. Some states have passed legislation or enacted policies in this regard, but others have not. This sets up a disparity and causes undue stress for families- what is available for students in one state is not available in all states. The USDOE OSEP has included interveners in the RFA's for the state deafblind projects and through the support of the development of training modules. While this has helped to spread the word about the benefits of interveners, more wrk needs to be done to help school districts understand the difference an intervener can make for the educational outcomes of students who are deafblind.

This phenomenon is one the Department of Education can absolutely influence and change, since they are charged with enforcing the guidelines already in place.

They are also helpful in ensuring that school staff understand their obligations under federal law. Most students and families are unable to secure representation because of the cost and relative rarity of special education law practices around the country. This puts them at a disadvantage when negotiating with school districts, which normally have in-house or contract counsel to represent their interests and provide them with advice.\n\nPlease do not eliminate these important resources for students and parents.","363":"I strenuously urge U.S. DoE to repeal and replace 34 CFR Part 99 effective January 2012.

","373":"\nDear Secretary DeVos,\n\nAs a teacher, administrator and parent, I believe all children deserve a great education and to feel safe and welcomed in their classrooms. When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nIn my thirty years working at schools in New York City and Chicago, it became apparent that some students were not treated as fairly as others. From the lack of understanding of the effects of poverty, mostly stemming from trauma due to historical and systemic racism, African American and Latinx students in particular are not given the same access to educational quality as other students, especially white students. The curriculum does not reflect their lives or experiences as out does that of white students and teachers, even those with good intentions, often fail to understand the needs of these students. On another issue, parents and staff are often resistant to accepting the fact that children begin experiencing non-heteronormative sexual identities during their elementary years. Without feeling accepted for who they are and what they feel, these students can become alienated from their peers and teachers and, as a result, lose out on important years of their schooling. \n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all children. America should be a place where every child, no matter their unique challenges, their unique needs, or where they come from, can grow up to be what they dream.\n \nSincerely,\n","374":"Without early childhood intervention my daughter would have had issues sitting up.. walking..earing..talkng.\nIt was much needed therapy","375":"As you evaluate existing regulations, please do not make changes to the early intervention programs that help so many young children with disabilities.

It puts them behind other children their age instead of creating opportunities for them to thrive and for their families to learn how to help them thrive. Without these programs, the children and their families will receive a clear message: They are not important enough. They don't deserve help. And that simply is not true. My son received physical, vision and speech therapy through early intervention, and today he is a thriving 4-year-old who is ready for kindergarten.

That number is extremely high, and it will not be lowered if we do not make the universities take responsibility for what happens on their campuses. This is not a partisan issue, everyone should be demanding change. Young women cannot continue to be sent off to college and face the current risk of being attacked by a fellow student.

The regulations that are of a direct concern to me are the following.Assistance to States for the Education of Children with Disabilities (Part 300)\nEarly Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities (Part 303)\nService Obligations under Special Education Personnel Development to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities (Part 304)\nDisability and Rehabilitation Research Projects and Centers Program (Part 350)\nDisability and Rehabilitation Research: Research Fellowships (Part 356) \nOur son was born with Hydrocephalus and given a rather bleak outlook during his first year of life.  Through the help of early intervention and special school district services, he has overcome many obstacles that were placed in front of him.  We were told he may not walk independently.  We were told he may need assistance with verbal communication.  Through the Missouri First Steps program we were connected with wonderful early intervention Physical, Occupational, and Speech therapists.  We were empowered with tools to assist him reach his full potential on a daily basis.  When he was 3 years old he was able to attend a SSD classroom with assistance in helping him walk and talk among other things.  After 2 years of preschool he was able to walk into Kindergarten and was able to spend almost half of his school day with his typical peers due to one on one support from a paraprofessional.  His peers motivated him to keep working hard and taught him how to socialize and be a friend.  He is now in 5th grade and still spends half of his day with his general education peers.  He also has a wonderful relationship with his Special Education peers.  They are very important members of their school community where inclusion matters to all.  Without the support of his SSD staff and teachers, our son would not be where he is today.  He has various daily challenges due to his Hydrocphalus, but lucky for us fighting for special school services has not been one of them.  Our school district is always able to meet his daily needs and help him become the best version of himself.  I fear that modifications to the above regulations may impact his future in middle school and high school.  They also may not give other younger individuals the same wonderful opportunities that Patrick has been provided.  Today he is walking, talking, laughing at all of the typical things boys his age find humorous and he is very excited to head off to Middle School next year!

Created in 2007, CSU-Globals mission is to facilitate adult success in a global marketplace through career relevant education.\n\nI recommend these areas of Federal financial aid for review and revision or repeal:\n\nSubsidized Usage Limit Applies (SULA):  This regulation limits students loan subsidy on their subsidized loans for 150% of the published program length, after which they lose the subsidy which increases the debt burden to the student.  The calculation is pro-rated based on enrollment status during the program and can change if the student changes programs or schools.  It is an extremely complicated calculation, and is highly burdensome to administrators and difficult for students and their families to understand and anticipate when their subsidy ends.  It is also redundant since there are already annual and aggregate loan limits that reduce students ability to borrow subsidized loans, as well as other programs in place such as Satisfactory Academic Progress that give students incentive to graduate on time.\n\nReturn to Title IV (R2T4):  R2T4 regulations are complex and cumbersomeover 200 pages in the FSA handbook are dedicated to R2T4 and the calculations.  Furthermore, it hurts the very students financial aid is supposed to help.  Institutions are required to make funds available to students as early as possible but if a student withdraws, we are required to use this calculation to return a portion of their loans and sometimes Pell grant, which can result in the student owing a balance to the school that they do not generally have the cash on hand to pay.  This often subsequently prohibits the student from re-enrolling the next term.  Since loans have to be paid back anyway, it makes little sense to take back funds that were required to be disbursed as soon as possible in the beginning of the term, especially since there are extenuating circumstances that forced the student to withdraw.\n\nFederal Loan Program Annual Borrowing Limits: Like grants, loan borrowing should be based on enrollment status in each payment period so students receive a pro-rated amount based on their enrollment status.  This would help tremendously in reducing over-borrowing by students, which is a significant problem across the country.  Students who attend only half-time are able to take out the same amount in loans as a full-time student, but they earn only half the amount of credits. Students with these patterns run out of financial aid before they are able to complete their program. Further, within this model, students attending less than half-time should be able to take out loans since they are pro-rated.  This would dramatically increase access to more studentsparticularly working students--who want to attend school but dont have the time to go at least half-time.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments and please let me know if you have questions or would like additional information.\n\nPamela Toney\n","390":"I have a daughter with Hydrocephalus and because as a parent I didn't know my rights and what was available to her to be successful in school my daughter suffers extreme anxiety and depression.

This program facilitates the employment of approximately 500 people with disabilities annually.\n\nWe applaud the efforts of Secretary DeVos in seeking input on regulations and policies that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification.  This is in accordance with Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda.\" \n\nWith respect to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE)\/ Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), I am very concerned that regulations implementing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) not only exceeded the scope of the act, but most importantly have resulted in reduction of job creation activities and in many cases have caused the elimination of employment through the Javits-Wagner-O'Day\/Abilty One and state use contracting opportunities. I  believe this has occurred due to regulations implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment contained in rule [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] and in the publication of new policies within the Rehabilitation Services Administration under the heading of FAQs.   \n\nSpecifically, the definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)) was rewritten during the regulatory process.  The Department of Education changed what Congress intended by narrowing what qualifies as competitive integrated employment by adding the condition \"is at a location typically found in the community.\"  This condition is not specifically established in the law and was incorrectly interpreted to exclude community rehabilitation programs that as an aggregate employ over 50,000 people with disabilities. The regulatory definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" should be eliminated and replaced with the definition that appears in the WIOA statute. \n\nIn both the definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (CIE) and the definition of \"integrated setting\" (34 CFR 361.5(c)(32)), the Department describes integration occurring at the \"work unit\" level.  This language is also not found in the WIOA statute. Defining integration as occurring at the \"work unit\" level is job limiting and would be impossible to apply to the general workforce given that people with disabilities have every right to their privacy. The \"work unit\" language specifically targets people who work for non-profit providers of employment services to people with disabilities. This language treats people with disabilities differently from the workforce at large and the non-profit service provider differently than any other employer. The sub definition of the \"work unit\" should be eliminated from the regulations.  \n\nThe Department of Education and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) did not stop with the narrow interpretation of competitive integrated employment and the definition of the \"work unit;\" they added a presumption that jobs falling under programs intended to employ people with disabilities would not qualify as an employment outcome under the law. RSA incorporated this message into FAQs that the RSA posted on January 18, 2017. Subsequently, State VR offices in numerous states have stopped referring people with disabilities to good jobs that meet their needs, including jobs under the federal AbilityOne program and State Set-Aside programs. This is not what Congress intended. These FAQs represent a significant change of federal policy. The FAQs are a carryover from the last administration that is costing people jobs by eliminating referrals from State VR agencies. The Department should eliminate the FAQs and RSA should advise the State VR offices that AbilityOne jobs and State Use contracting jobs presumptively do qualify as competitive integrated employment.\n\nThe narrow interpretations of CIE and integrated settings have ultimately diminished work opportunities for people with disabilities. The Department should focus on expanding employment choice for people with disabilities, not limiting it.  People with disabilities want and deserve a full array of options in employment.  A definition that limits their menu of choices will not lead to further integration, but rather will reduce opportunities and cost people with disabilities jobs.\n\n","392":"My daughter was born with hydrocephalus via c section at 37 weeks, had brain surgery to insert a shunt at 6 days old.

I am an advocate for them that does grassroots organizing, outreach, and fundraising in the local counties of Denver. One of the main reasons we have been going door-to-door as an organization for over thirty years is because as a society we blame survivors for the crime perpetrated against them. Every day I combat victim blaming language such as \"Women shouldn't be out so late if they don't want to be raped.\" or, well \"Why are women at parties anyway.\" or, \"The way women and girls dress these days it's no wonder the stats are so high.\" or, one that is most applicable here: \"I just hate how these boys have there reputations ruined forever.\"  I use stats to combat this widely held and false rhetoric, and this is where Title IX comes into play: rape is never the victim's fault. 90-98% of rape reports are true, and 97% of rapists never see a day in prison. (These are Colorado based statistics from the CDC and FBI). \n\nThe problem in our society is we do not believe, help, and support rape survivors. Instead we worry about a \"promising young man's future\". By making comments that level the ground for rapists and survivors, we are once again ignoring the majority of reports and survivors who are not supported and who must see their rapists have more support than they do. This is wrong and a gross injustice. We need to uphold Title IX regulations in order to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions and to support the right people, the survivors. This is just one way to continue the work that needs to happen in our society in order to combat victim-blaming and support of the wrong people: perpetrators of assault. We know that rapists are usually repeat offenders; that rapists are few and far between but that they get away with the crime again and again because we do not hold them accountable.

That process must be fair, equitable, and trauma informed. I would like to address why I believe Universities should continue to handle sexual misconduct cases under the current guidance. \n\nSurvivors have a right to have an internal process at their Universities, and many students who go through Title IX processes choose not to go report to the police because the remedies available do not meet their more immediate needs of access to education. Many legal cases take significant time and resources, meaning missed class that may extend beyond the student's time at the University or study on campus. Significantly fewer students report to police than University officials because of these concerns, and if Universities were required to defer to local police, this would be a significant deterrent for students reporting sexual violence on campus. Far fewer students would report and would instead choose to transfer, drop out, or simply heal without seeking formal justice. \n\nUniversities already regulate illegal activities on their campuses  - alcohol and drug consumption, physical fights between students, hate speech, etc. That is part of having conduct processes and community standards. If Universities were to no longer have an internal procedure for handling sexual misconduct, the same logic should apply to these other crimes on campuses, which is unreasonable financially and logistically. \n\nWe do not need more attention to the rights of accused students because those are ensured in the current guidance; we need more consistent application and education of the current guidance that is not motivated by fear of lawsuit.

Implementation takes time, and there is still work to be done.  The solution is to keep and enforce Title IX guidance, while continuing to improve upon it by: supporting schools in development of equitable and transparent procedures; increasing participation in high-quality training; and adopting best-practices in student conduct policies, processes, prevention, and survivor care.  As someone who personally worked along side Title IX investigators and coordinators as a victim advocate, I was appalled by the way Secretary DeVos cherry-picked examples and mischaracterized not only the spirit of Title IX but it's actual requirements.  For every example Secretary DeVos gave of due process being denied, I can site back an equal number of cases (if not more) where both parties were provided the same rights -- to give statements, present evidence, read the allegations against them, respond to allegations, have an advisor, the right to appeal etc.  Any university not following these procedures and upholding the rights of both parties is not following Title IX correctly.  Any university not following Title IX correctly should be held accountable.  The solution is not to throw out Title IX.  In the criminal legal system there are cases of individuals wrongly accused of murder and sent to prison, only to be redeemed later based on new evidence or an appeal.  The solution to this problem is not to throw out murder laws, but instead to improve processes and procedures related to investigation and prosecution.  To imply that perhaps universities don't have a role to play in sexual assault (or domestic violence and stalking) is to vastly underestimate the remedies that schools can provide, or the importance of those non-criminal\/legal remedies.  If a student at the high school level beats up another student (which is a crime -- assault), we expect the school to respond.  We don't tell the victim that if they want the other student held accountable they have to go to the police, and in the meantime go back to class with the person who just assaulted you.  And while personal examples or case studies provide valuable information, ultimately the conclusions that Secretary DeVos makes regarding Title IX are not grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the statistics related to sexual assault, false accusations, or Title IX processes.  I am disheartened that instead of looking at Title IX holistically, and with a basis in fact, the Secretary is seeming to parrot the biased, and false, narrative of Men's Right's groups such as the National Coalition for Men, SAVE, and Families Advocating for Campus Equality.  On a more personal note, as a victim advocate I have often been entrusted with the stories of sexual assault survivors, some who reported and some who didn't.  For some, what they wanted out of the system was simply to drop a class or switch a class without consequences (example, after the drop deadline).  Title IX allows them to do this.  Dropping a class is such a simple request, and yet without Title IX many victims wouldn't have had that option.  Listen to the hundreds of thousands of individuals who have been impacted by interpersonal violence, listen to the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to Title IX implementation.  You can be a champion for due process while still protecting victims.  Don't buy into a false narrative that at its core doesn't believe sexual assault is a problem.  Sexual assault is pervasive, it can be devastating, and it is time we did something about it.  ","406":"Letter from: National Association of Federally Impacted Schools.

The importance of this access has been repeatedly established through laws asserting and protecting the rights of students with disabilities to receive free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment possible. \nGenerations of students with disabilities have achieved their educational goals in US schools under the protections of a number of landmark laws and their implementing regulations.

It is our understanding that the USED is looking for input into which federal regulations should be retained or revised as potential over-reaches of federal administrative overreach.  Providing special education and related services to students with disabilities should never be viewed as a burden for public schools.  All students, including students with disabilities, should be held to high expectations and have equitable access to educational opportunities that enrich their lives and prepare them for future success.  We should never forget the Congressional findings and purpose when passing P.L. 94-142: (1) there are more than eight million children with disabilities in the United States today; (2) the special educational needs of such children are not being fully met; (3) more than half of the children with disabilities in the United States do not receive appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity; (4) one million of the children with disabilities in the United States are excluded entirely from the public school system and will not go through the educational process with their peers; (5) there are many children with disabilities throughout the United States participating in regular school programs whose disabilities prevent them from having a successful educational experience because their disabilities are undetected; (6) because of the lack of adequate services within the public school system, families are often forced to find services outside the public school system, often at great distance from their residence and at their own expense; (7) developments in the training of teachers and in diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods have advanced to the point that, given appropriate funding, State and local educational agencies can and will provide effective special education and related services to meet the needs of children with  disabilities; (8) State and local educational agencies have a responsibility to provide education for all children with disabilities, but present financial resources are inadequate to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities; and (9) it is in the national interest that the Federal Government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities in order to assure equal protection of the law.\n\nIt was the purpose of P.L. 94-142 to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.\n\nToday, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), all children with disabilities have the right to be enrolled in and attend school, and to receive a free appropriate public education.  But this right must be carefully guarded and the rights and protections afforded to students with disabilities and their parents under the IDEA must not be eroded.  The regulations at 34 CFR Part 300 implement the statutory requirements of the IDEA and should be retained.\n\nIn particular we wish to emphasize that the state complaint procedures (34 CFR 300.151 through 300.153) should be retained.  While some comments in 2006 suggested that the state complaint procedures should be limited, this procedure gives parents an easy and quick means to resolve disputes with schools and to address procedural violations.  Without the broad coverage that the state complaint process affords, many parents will effectively be left without a remedy as they will be unable to navigate the due process procedures which are much more complicated and typically involve attorneys on both sides.  The complexity and cost of due process hearings makes that process out of reach of many.\n","424":"Dear Secretary DeVos,\n\nAs an attorney working at the New York City Anti-Violence Project, an organization that focuses on responding to anti-LGBTQ violence, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and hate crimes, I believe that all students deserve a great education and to feel safe and welcomed in their classrooms. When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are LGBTQ, Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL students get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nAs an attorney supporting LGBTQ and HIV affected survivors of violence I know intimately, the role that guidance and rules can play to assist survivors access services and receive institutional support. As LGBTQ people face disproportionate violence than their heterosexual and cisgender peers, it is paramount that our schools take a stance to end bullying and harassment and intervene when sexual assault occurs, or other forms of violence, including intimate partner violence and hate violence. Fortunately, several of my clients who attend New York City institutions of higher education have been able to report incidences of violence by abusive partners who were also students at the same campus and subsequently secure protection from them. This is because those institutions had policies and procedures in place for identifying violence regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, and mechanisms to support students to report. \n\nDespite the protections that exist, all too often our agency receives reports from clients that law enforcement fails to appropriately intervene or investigate reports of same sex violence, as well as misconduct based on myths about LGTBQ people. Such harmful practices include transgender people being arrested or brutalized by law enforcement even if they are the victim; the more masculine presenting person in a lesbian relationship being arrested even if they are the survivor; police refusing to take reports when there is violence between two men leaving the victim without protection. For this reason, allowing schools to shirk responsibility and leave responses to violence to law enforcement is a huge mistake. If the Department of Education repeals guidance and regulations for schools to protect survivors of sexual assault and to treat students fairly regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity the DOE is not only doing students a disservice but an inviting the escalation of violence. The DOE should be doing more not less to create safe schools. Violence is lethal. Homicides against LGBTQ people has increased in 2017. http:\/\/avp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/NCAVP-A-Crisis-of-Hate-Final.pdf\n\nThe New York City Anti-Violence Project is a member of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Progams (NCAVP), comprised of more than 50 organizations and groups across the country that work to prevent and respond to violence against the LGBTQ and HIV affected communities.  In our role as LGBTQ anti-violence advocates, we see first-hand the challenges LGBTQ students face in our school systems, and we know that LGBTQ students are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault, misconduct and violence. The 2016 Youth Risk Behavior Survey reported that lesbian, gay, and bisexual high school students were 3x more likely to have been forced to have sexual intercourse than their heterosexual peers. Furthermore, data form the Association of American Universities showed that students who identified as transgender, gender queer or non-binary had the highest rates of sexual assault amongst both undergraduate and graduate students. Any rollback of Title IX protections for student survivors will undoubtedly serve to undermine the dignity of LGBTQ student survivors making it dangerous to report violence and drastically altering the way they experience their school environments.\n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all students. We urge you not to roll-back these protections.\n\nSincerely,\nDale Melchert\n\n","425":"We am writing in support of the comments provided by the National Center for Parent Leadership, Advocacy, and Community Empowerment on the review of US Department of Education regulations and guidance. Our perspective is from a statewide organization that has served more than 54,000 families in the last 20 years - assisting families in ensuring access to quality, equitable education.\n\nThere's concern about the proposed process of wholesale evaluation of existing regulations for the purpose of repeal, replacement, or modification reflected by Executive Order 13777, which we believe is both unusual and misguided.  The process of promulgating regulations is codified in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and is a bedrock of administrative law.  The ED regulations listed for possible \"repeal, replace or modify\" have already gone through the open, transparent, and prescribed procedure mandated by the APA: review of a draft rule by the Office of Management and Budget; 30-90 days for public comment\/feedback; a review of all comments and development of responses by the responsible agency; revision of proposed regulations that are sent to OMB for final review; and in some cases, a second comment period before publication of final regulations.  \n\nAs part of this process, the costs and benefits of regulatory action are already considered, as well as estimation of the time necessary to report information required by the regulations, consultation with elected officials in state and local governments affected by the regulations, and other steps that together ensure that development of regulations is based on a wide range of input and sound information.  Further, the normal process of promulgating regulations already takes into account the factors included in Executive Order 13777.\n\nWhile agencies should periodically review their regulations to ensure that they remain relevant and effective, eliminating regulations for the sake of elimination is harmful and misguided.  The US Department of Education's Mission Statement, to \"promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access,\" should guide any such review.  Any effort to repeal, replace, or modify regulations without regard to the impact on the diverse students and families served by the Department, and without the deep and meaningful input of those diverse students and families, will violate that Mission Statement and cause real harm to diverse students and diminish the involvement and role of their families.\n\nNo wholesale review of regulations and non-regulatory guidance, particularly within such a limited time span, can do justice to the thoughtful, participatory process needed to ensure a high-quality, fair, and equitable outcome.\n\nWe oppose any specific proposals to weaken the regulations and non-regulatory guidance that protects our nation's most vulnerable students and the participation and involvement of their families.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you to strengthen existing regulations and guidance as needed.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to provide these comments.\n","426":"Please withdraw the changes made to FERPA on January 2012.

Our mission is to provide employment to people who are blind. We fulfill this mission by providing quality products and services to the government through the AbilityOne Program. \nWe have concerns over regulatory rules and language that the Department of Education put into place for WIOA. The language and rules have caused confusion with our local VR agency, the Bureau of Services for Blind persons. The language and the rules have been interpreted to mean that any agency that provides employment through the AbilityOne Program is not an integrated work environment. This interpretation automatically makes employees working through the AbilityOne program ineligible for services.\nThe impact of the misinterpretation of the Department of Education rules surrounding the WIOA has taken away our employees ability to choose where they work while receiving services to improve their marketable skills. In the paragraphs that follow you will find examples of how this has impacted our employees.\nWe have an employee who was receiving computer training to become a transcriptionist from our local VR agency here in Kalamazoo, MI. After the rule was implemented in 2016, her case was closed and she was told that it was closed because she worked for an AbilityOne Agency. She could continue her training only if she ended her employment with us.\nOur Customer Services Representative was also receiving services though our local VR agency. These services included potential return to college as well as life skills services to adjust to his continual decline in vision. Once he started working for our agency his case was terminated even though he still needed services adapting to his surroundings and coping with his vision loss. He was told by our local VR agency that he was ineligible for services because of where he works an AbilityOne agency.\nWe also have a production associate that wanted to learn how to use the computer. She is close to retirement age and wanted to have a new set of skills so that she could start her own home business during her retirement. She needed help from the local VR agency with equipment, special screen reading software and training. She has worked for our agency for years and received the start of services while working here. Her services were cut off last year after the WIOA regulatory rules were put into place. She went in for an appointment with the local VR agency and was told by her counselor that if she quit her job at our agency she could have anything that she wanted.\nWe have implemented a training center for our employees and partnered with Hadley School for the Blind to provide independent training opportunities.  They have the opportunity to learn basic to advanced skills and are paid their hourly wage while in training. Each employee works independently on their marketable skills in the training center, but we need your help. It would really help them to have access to the local VR agency's services. They are trained professionals that serve as a roadmap to the success of people who are blind; the VR agency is the bridge to the access of new technologies and services that promote competitive skills and growth for people who are blind.\nThis misunderstanding of the regulatory rules put into place for WIOA has negatively impacted our employees who have chosen to work. The VR services should be available to our employees on a case by case basis. We can show the Bureau of Services for Blind Persons that our employees do work in an integrated environment that promotes growth and opportunities for upward mobility.\nWe are taxpaying citizens who work for an AbilityOne agency that takes pride in providing quality products to the government. The only thing that is blocking them from the potential of these services is a misunderstanding of the Department of Education's regulatory rules by the local VR agency. \nJust to share a little bit about myself. I have been visually impaired since birth. I am the single mom of 3 children. When I started out as a seasonal employee here at MidWest Enterprises for the Blind working in production I needed an income to take care of my family.  At the time I could not find a job in my degree field, computer networking. I have been with our agency for 10 years and have been promoted to IT specialist and Admin Assistant. In 2010 the company opened my eyes to advocacy for people who are blind. I started out with just a job, but found my passion for people as MidWest Enterprises for the Blind's Public Policy Liaison.\nThank you for taking the time to read our concerns, if you would like to discuss this further I welcome the opportunity to share with you more.\nMisty Stenberg\nPublic Policy Liaison, 269.383.0713 x210\n","431":"I am a person w Hydrocephalus.

As a woman and citizen who works with survivors of sexual assault, specifically youth, I would like to tell the entirely unqualified DeVos that she should be ashamed of herself as she has made it clear she does not care about those brutally raped, abused, and exploited. However, this decision does make it abundantly obvious she unwaveringly supports one group of people: rapists and other perpetrators of sexual assault. Fact tells us rape is falsely reported NO MORE than any other crime AND, in reality, we know sexual assault is tragically underreported because of attitudes perpetuated by ignorance like that of DeVos.\n\nBetsy DeVos: Your actions are un-American, cruel, and deplorable.

Incidents of sexual assault on college campuses are alarmingly frequent - one in five women and one in sixteen men will be sexually assaulted in college, and over ninety percent of these students will not report the assault. (National Sexual Violence Resource Center - Statistics about Sexual Violence, 2015)\n\nIt is imperative the Department of Education provides protections to survivors under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Instead of stripping away Title IX implementation regulations, we urge the Department to work to support survivors of violence and provide additional resources to schools and colleges to combat the culture of violence. \n\nTitle IX requires schools that receive federal funding to provide equal access to educational programs and activities. Sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking create hostile educational environments that impede survivors ability to achieve their full potential in both educational and extracurricular settings. Removing the regulatory guidance runs counter to the intention of the law and will lead to a greater risk for survivors. Additionally, removal of the Title IX implementation guidance denies both survivors and accused perpetrators the rigorous adjudication process students deserve.\n\nJWI provides critically important proactive, prevention programming on college campuses, teaching students about sexual assault, dating abuse, and bystander intervention.  Through our multi-faceted holistic program, Change the Culture, we hear from scores of students who want more prevention education. A revocation of Title IX guidance will make it challenging to provide this information to students and create the cultural changes needed on campuses.  \n\nEvery student deserves equal protection under the law.

We moved from TX to MA because the lack of focus on special needs kids by the Texas Education Agency--and the lack of sufficient funds on the state and local levels for special education--made it impossible for our children to receive a free and appropriate education. It was cheaper, and less emotionally taxing on us and on our children, to move rather than to file lawsuits to force the TX system to change.\n\nAs you know, the US Dept. of Education is currently investigating TX for instituting a secret cap of 8.5% on the number of children each school district should permit to access special education services. School districts that exceed that cap have been penalized. (As you might know, the national norm is roughly 15% of a student population in special education.)

That is why I am urging the Department of Education not to repeal, replace, or modify current civil rights regulations. The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents, such as the guidance on: sexual harassment (including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence) ; racial and disability-based harassment; access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical education; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners.\n\nFederal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex (Title IX); race, color and national origin (Title VI); and disability (Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). To be effective, however, the federal government must enforce the law, provide oversight, and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized. Current regulations and guidance help make students rights a reality and must be maintained. Seeking to deliberately disadvantage classes of people already under stresses not experienced by the powerful minority of officialdom is unacceptable on its face. The US must remove roadblocks in our institutions; not create them.","477":"As a college student, activist, and survivor, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is incredibly important to protect my rights, make me feel like my campus prioritizes my safety, and has the ability to intervene in future incidents. When something happened to me, I was able to speak with a confidential advocate on my campus. For over a week I had been unable to focus, emotionally unpredictable and frustrated. After speaking with her, I was able to understand that all of my feelings about the incident were normal and okay. I felt like what happened was my fault and that it was my responsibility to make it okay within myself. The advocate I spoke to assured me that nothing that I could do would make someone raping me okay. I was human and I deserve respect and kindness, especially by men I know well. This interaction made me feel like my campus had resources that cared about me personally somewhere within the large bureaucracy. DCL is imperative not just for interactions like mine, but also for the hundreds of women who are sexually harassed each day. I am grateful that my university takes my safety and right to a respectful environment seriously. The law cannot punish sexual harassment, but the university systems can. As a female student, that makes me feel more protected and valued, it sends a message that my body isn't the right of the male population. As an activist, prevention of future incidents is the ultimate goal. If we take away resources from college campuses, we lose the opportunity for colleges to provide prevention and education that is specific to the culture of their campus. There is data about what kind of prevention works, and what doesn't. Educating those who are most likely to be perpetrators is the best way to prevent harm. In order to do that effectively, colleges need to be able to identify those at a high risk for perpetration and educate them.

While our previous comments were in regard to state authorization regulations, these comments focus on regulations for distance education and educational technologies in higher education.\n\nOur comment is included in the uploaded file.","479":"I am submitting these comments in regards to WIOA Section 511 regulations in my experience as an executive at a nonprofit employment services organization for people with disabilities. \nThe intent of WIOA, to reduce the number of people with disabilities working in center-based environments where they may earn subminimum wage, is laudable. However, the implementation of the regulations has placed hardships on my organization, our clients with disabilities, and the guardians of our clients.\n1.The administrative burden placed on service providers has included significant hours of additional reporting and communications with clients and guardians to ensure that any client who earns less than federal minimum wage at any time is tracked and receives information on attending an informed choice meeting and career counseling session with the local Center for Independent Living (CIL) as contracted by the DSU. This is especially burdensome for clients who work predominantly in community jobs at or above minimum wage and only work on a piece rate job once in a while or for a very short interval.  Recommendation: clients who work the majority of the time in a minimum wage job should be exempt from having to participate in the informed choice and career counseling sessions and this exemption must be simple for service providers to determine and record.\n2.The time and travel required for guardians to attend the required career counseling meeting  outside of their normally scheduled annual and semi-annual reviews is a burden for many, especially those who live a great distance from the client or who snow-bird. Recommendation: reduce the six month and annual requirement for the first year of employment to only once in the first year with leniency so it can align with annual review meeting. Reduce the annual requirement for all others to every 3 years for those who say, \"No, I do not want to seek competitive integrated employment\" at the most recent career counseling meeting. For clients above the age of 55, if they say \"No, I do not want to seek competitive integrated employment,\" then they should have the right to opt out of all future career counseling sessions.\n3.For transition students, the elimination of the option to work in non-integrated settings requires service providers to find community businesses willing to open their doors and allow us to bring in students to try-out work who we have had little to no opportunity to assess in work readiness. Before, WIOA, we could bring students into our center-based work environment and spend time getting to know them and their interests, strengths, and stamina in a true work setting before heading to community jobs. Under WIOA, we must do the work component of that in an integrated setting where behaviors or personal care needs might impact the acceptance of an employer and burn bridges when we request to bring others in the future. For those who struggle with behaviors, maturity or work readiness, their struggles at work will be public. Recommendation: make WIOA person-centered and allow transition students and youth to choose where they receive their employment services - do not force them into integrated settings if they would prefer to work in a center-based environment first rather than at a community-based job. This can be done while earning minimum wage.\n","480":"Ms. Hilary Malawer\n\nAssistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel\n\nU.S. Department of Education\n\n400 Maryland Ave SW, Room 6E231\n\nWashington DC 20202\n\n \n\nRe: Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\n\n \n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\nMy daughter works at Blue Mountain Industries in Walla Walla Washington.

State aid programs are specifically permitted by law to receive FAFSA data, but Tribal higher education aid programs are not included under this law. \nUnder HEA 483(b)(3)(E), the Secretary may designate other entities to which FAFSA data may be released.  To ensure students' access to tribal scholarship is not hampered, ED should exercise its authority to designate tribal scholarship program administrators as entities eligible to obtain FAFSA data from schools.\n\nReturn of Title IV Funds (\"R2T4\")\nWhile many R2T4 requirements are statutory, ED should use its authority to simplify and streamline R2T4 to the extent possible.  I concur with the recommendation to this Docket submitted by NASFAA and its comment: \"Schools do not aspire to fail tests of compliance.  Any area of regulation, including but not limited to R2T4, that consistently trips up schools should be reviewed for reasonableness, complexity, and effectiveness.\"\nIn the interim, please add advanced R2T4 training sessions to the FSA conference, for traditional coursework and programs taught in modules.  Although ED regularly offers R2T4 sessions, the examples used are too basic and not reflective of actual student attendance\/withdrawal patterns.  Given that R2T4 issues are a top program review finding, there should be plenty of complex examples readily available as educational material.  Also, the fin aid community could readily provide more examples.  Lastly, the session slides should explain not only the correct R2T4 action, but WHY it is the proper course of action so that this detail is available for reference.\n\nLoan Counseling\nInstitutions are held accountable for their student's borrowing habits and publicly crucified for students' high debt levels, even though schools prohibited from restricting student borrowing or mandating ongoing loan counseling to students to ensure students understand the obligations they are incurring.  Entrance counseling, which is conducted when students are more concerned with settling into the \"college experience\" is ineffective at best, and sadly is completely forgotten by most.  Many students never recall even completing loan counseling, even when the school can document that the student attended a live session or completed an online program.\nED should permit schools to require students to complete loan counseling (similar to entrance counseling) prior to receiving each additional loan.  This would allow schools to reinforce loan obligations and responsible borrowing.  Furthermore, as part of Higher Education Act Reauthorization, ED should encourage Congress to allow institutions to establish lesser annual or aggregate loan limits for its students, at either an institutional or program level, so the institution can prevent its students from over-borrowing, especially when the institution knows that higher borrowing levels will likely be unmanageable for its students.\n\nVerification\nReduce the data elements that must be verified by an institution, limiting them to only the specific data elements identified by the CPS as problematic (and any associated items that may be directly related). \nAdditionally, eliminate the requirement for financial aid professionals to validate an individual's tax filing status and instead allow the IRS to police its own regulations.  Falsification of tax status is tax evasion that should be addressed by the IRS, and should not be dragged into the financial aid process.  .  Resolution of this status puts financial aid administrators in the position of auditing IRS documents, resolving tax issues, and\/or second-guessing professional tax preparer's judgment. \n\nReporting and Disclosures\nThe volume of data that institutions must report to ED, as well as the volume of data that must be collected and disclosed to consumers, has gone far beyond burdensome. \nAlthough some of these requirements are statutory and would need to be addressed by Congress, ED should seek ways of streamlining the amount of data that is required to be provided by institutions, eliminating duplicative\/redundant data elements, and assess the timing of the appropriate point to collect and\/or report data.  \n\nGainful Employment and Borrower Defense to Repayment\nED should proceed with its announced intention to renegotiate these two sets of poorly written and overly burdensome regulations.\n\nI respectfully request your consideration of these issues.","490":"I urge you to enforce the existing laws to protect ALL students from discrimination of any sort.

However, these survivors still deserve to feel safe in their schools. Additionally, justice does not always equal prosecution.

When a school or a school district doesnt treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. I can remember instances during the 1950s-60s when the Federal government did step in.\n\nIn order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. As a public educator, I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. These students face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve. Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. \n\nI oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nIn my science classes, I have had students who were Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants (from Cuba, Mexico, Serbia, Russia, Viet Nam), English language learners, girls, boys, LGBTQ, or students with disabilities. I tried my best to provide a quality education in an environment that was safe and conducive to learning. Shouldn't the Department of Education be able to make a similar claim?\n\nIt is the Department of Educations job to help our nations schools provide high-quality education for all children. America should be a place where every child, no matter their unique challenges, their unique needs, or where they come from, can grow up to be what they dream.\n\nSincerely,\nMary L.

As a psychotherapist working with survivors of sexual trauma, I have seen first-hand the impact that finding some for of justice have for survivors and their families. According to RAINN (https:\/\/www.rainn.org\/statistics\/criminal-justice-system), two out of three sexual assaults go unreported. Based on these astonishingly low reporting rates, survivors can only benefit from an additional reporting option, a unique right that Title IX provides for victims of gender-based violence.

The school district's failure to recognize her Title IX rights guaranteeing an equal education free from sexual harassment, to acknowledge with compassion her report of sexual assault, to promptly and equitably investigate, to prevent retaliation, and to treat her with basic human dignity has been life-scaring beyond description. Our efforts to hold those responsible were met with avoidance, denial, misinformation, falsification, and violations at every juncture. \n\nShe was further betrayed by her school, which failed to implement the steps set forth in Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) guidance that would have allowed her to continue her education, free from retaliation, after the assault. Instead, she was treated like a second-class citizen while a male athlete perpetrator, who had previously been disciplined for sexual misconduct, was allowed to continue his education as a valued member of the school community.\n\nIn response to our complaint, OCR opened an investigation into the district's mishandling of our daughter's sexual assault. As a result, the district rewrote its sexual misconduct policy and hired a full time Title IX Coordinator. \n\nWe launched a national nonprofit Stop Sexual Assault in Schools (SSAIS.org) so that other K-12 families would be spared our nightmare. That's why OCR guidance from 2011 and 2014 must be strengthened and enforced, not rescinded.

Postponing the enforcement date until July 1, 2019 would allow institutions more time to comply with the new regulations, particularly related to California.  \n\nOver the past few of years, state regulators came together to work on a reciprocity agreement known as SARA.  This agreement allows institutions that are in states that are part of the reciprocity agreement to apply to their state regulator to join SARA which in turn allows them the ability to offer distance education in other member states without having to apply to each state for authorization. This agreement has created an efficient and effective means approval in each state.  However, all but one state, California, has joined, or is in the process of joining.  \n\nThe problem with enforcing the Program Integrity and Improvement rule prior to California joining SARA is that hundreds of institutions across the nation will need to demonstrate authorization to serve students in California in order to be compliant with the new regulation.  Unfortunately, California does not currently have a department or system in place to accept applications for authorization for public and non-profit institutions, or to accept complaints for these institutions.  This leaves many institutions with an inability to properly serve students.  \n\nThere are some efforts underway in California to start the process to join SARA, but more time is needed.

There are no witch hunts, schools creating mini courtroom trials of their own, or any type of blocking from law enforcement getting involved. What Title IX has done is help victims figure out how they want to proceed beyond the aftermath of an assault or any other infraction of Title IX. I've known people who were accused and victims who navigated through the Title IX office process.

We held several meetings on site and not only sent out notices, called and reminded people.   For the most - people responded with a positive curiosity.  The SMILES (CILS) staff was very easy to work with and accommodating.  They communicated well with the individuals, guardians, and our site.   \nThe issues we experienced was a handful of guardians that didn't cooperate and attend the scheduled meetings after mailings, reminders, and several phone messages.  Also the difficulty for guardians that lived hours away from their family member who were receiving services.   SMILES was very helpful in letting some of them complete this by phone and mail.  SMILES even added extra meetings in our region to accommodate the stragglers.  \nThe spreadsheets and tracking took the most time to complete, revisit, and finalize. I had 85 individuals who qualified to go through this process.  I would estimate an extra 5 hours to attend the meetings that were held at our site after hours or on weekends.   Then an additional 10+ hours of paperwork (including preparing mailings; setting up the spreadsheet, and inputting data).   \nSeveral family members complained about the additional meetings; not fully understanding \"why?\" this had to be done; and also once it was done why it had to be done annually.   \n\nMy suggestions to improve the process in the future:\n1)  Look at an age limit - don't ask people 60+ if they are interested in community work.  It is nearly impossible to get someone hired if they are over 55 with or without disabilities. This is an excellent tool for younger individuals that are really interested and motivated to seek community and\/or competitive work.  It is not appropriate for people that have aged out of the job market.\n2) Continue to allow guardians that are at a distance the opportunity to do this by phone vs. in person.   Make it as easy for the guardian as possible.  On-line completion of documents may also be helpful.\n 3) If the answer was \"no\" - don't revisit it every year.   Less frequent follow-up should be an option.   Maybe even a check or drop down box indicating how often they (the individual and\/or the guardian) would like to be contacted about this.   Make it more person-centered and choice driven.   Respect their choice!\n4) This rule limited students from being able to access our in-house services where we had previously been able to work on their lack of soft skills before putting them in community jobs with limited success. Many don't understand soft skills, work rules, and employer expectations without lots of initial support.  This piece was crucial to the success of any individual who had limited work experience.  Students need to build their employment confidence to ensure success.  Limiting their initial choice to only community competitive work often sets them up for failure and a setback that is difficult to recover from.  They also can end up waiting for VRS to make a determination of the next step.\n5) It would be beneficial to provide this information at annual meetings instead of additional meetings.   \n","529":"Please do not take away protections for LGTBQ, poor, language minority, or students.

Defend the civil rights of ALL students!","544":"Responses to campus sexual assault must support survivors, uphold current available protections, and improve prevention.\n\n1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually assaulted while in college.  Yet, fewer than 10% of sexual assault victims on college\ncampuses report the assault.  Any changes in current protections that would make it more difficult for survivors to report or to be\nbelieved will have a chilling impact on already low reporting rates.\n\nThe Department of Education's Title IX sexual assault guidance and the Clery Act with Campus SaVE amendments are critically\nimportant tools for addressing campus sexual harassment and assault.\n\nTitle IX and the Clery Act are effective tools to support survivors, increase institutional transparency, hold individual offenders\naccountable and improve community safety.\n\nAll institutions of higher education need to maintain campus processes with standards befitting a non-criminal internal proceeding\nto respond to sexual misconduct.\n\nCampus disciplinary proceedings should use a standard of evidence ho higher than a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nSexual misconduct on campus, whether employee on employee, employee on student or student on student, should not be\ntolerated by any institution of higher education in this country and should never be a part of our higher education system, no\nmatter what institutions need to do to institute such policy guidelines.  To do otherwise would be to take a giant step backward\nwhich would demean potential sex assault victims and to place a black mark on our institutions of higher education.\n","545":"The Department of Education needs to uphold student's civil rights, including Title IX.\n \nPrior to the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, many colleges and universities were not being responsive to students who had been harmed by interpersonal and sexual violence, which was well documented by the Center for Public Integrity in 2010 (https:\/\/www.publicintegrity.org\/accountability\/education\/sexual-assault-campus). This report documents how students harmed were not receiving any kind of support or fair process, especially when schools weren't responding to the harm against them, condoned a hostile environment, or didn't include the student harmed in the school's response, if there was one. Revisions to the Title IX processes, including the preponderance of evidence standard, would revert campuses backwards. If the preponderance of evidence standard was changed, students who have been harmed would be up against a higher standard than students experiencing other types of discrimination under Title IV and Title VI, and employees under Title VII. Treating the students harmed by interpersonal violence, including sexual assault, stalking, and intimate partner violence, differently would be discriminatory.\n \nCampuses need to address the harm and hostile environment for the harmed students and the broader campus community. While you cited Respondents who state that they have not been treated fairly by campus processes, that is the case for students harmed as well (Center for Public Integrity, 2010; Chronicle of Higher Education Title IX Tracker, 2017 https:\/\/projects.chronicle.com\/titleix\/). Also, those who harm others are rarely held accountable by educational systems (Cantalupo & Kidder, 2017, https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2971447; Cantalupo, 2009). In addition, research on the criminal justice system demonstrates even fewer are held accountable (U.S. Department of Justice National Crime Victimization Study, 2015,  https:\/\/www.rainn.org\/statistics\/criminal-justice-system). Educational institutions need to hold people accountable for harming others with interpersonal violence; and the Department of Education needs to hold educational institutions accountable to following the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, which states that students need to be treated fairly.\n \nThe Department of Education also needs to take a good look at the empirical research about the impact of interpersonal violence before making any changes or rolling back the 2011\/2014 guidance which would further negatively impact harmed students. To better understand the impact and discrimination against students harmed, one could look to the studies about the academic impact on students who have been harmed. Most recently, one study found the impact on students who have been harmed, specifically reduced academic efficacy, institutional commitment, and scholastic conscientiousness, and a greater level of collegiate stress (Banyard, et.al., 2017, http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0886260517715022). Another study found students facing difficulty concentrating and lower grade point averages after experiences of sexual violence (Jordan, et.al., 2014). Yet another study found students harmed by intimate partners experienced negative academic consequences (LeBlanc, et.al., 2014). Finally, another found that students who have been harmed are more likely than other students to have to move residence halls and drop out of school (Krebs, et.al., 2007).\n \nThe physical, emotional, social, and financial toll on individuals who have been harmed is also well-documented by empirical research (CDC, 2017, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/sexualviolence\/consequences.html). These impacts include substance abuse as a coping mechanism, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (Black & Breiding, 2008; Bonomi et al., 2009; Breitenbecher, 2006; Kilpatrick et al., 2003; Ullman & Nadjowski, 2009; Ullman, Nadjowski, & Filipas, 2009). There are financial costs to the person harmed, as well as society (CDC, 2017, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/intimatepartnerviolence\/consequences.html). There is no scientific doubt that interpersonal violence, including stalking, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence, takes a toll on those harmed. Therefore it is disgusting to hear the comparison of the toll on Complainants and Respondents as if it is equal, because it most certainly is not.\n \nAll students need to be treated fairly by Title IX processes, both on campus and at the federal level. Ignoring or minimizing the impact on students who have been harmed will not end up treating all students fairly, it will continue discrimination against those harmed by violence.\n","546":"Earlier this month, Education Secretary Besty DeVos announced a new Title IX rule process and criticized the \"Dear Colleague\" letter, which was issued by the Office for Civil Rights in 2011, requiring schools nationally to make significant improvements to the way they responded to sexual violence.  On behalf of my colleagues at the Rape Victim Advocacy Program (RVAP), and in lockstep with our allies at the University of Iowa, at our sister victim advocacy agencies throughout the state and nationally, I am deeply troubled by the statements.  At RVAP, we are grateful for the opportunity to proudly stand with victims-survivors, and we will always defend Title IX, the \"Dear Colleague\" letter, and all the progress that has been made to ensure student safety and create effective policy.\n\nWe have come a long way since Title IX was passed in 1972, and we have too far yet to go to afford any steps backwards.  RVAP's mission is to create a community free from sexual violence, and the statements by Secretary DeVos push us backwards.  The new rule process creates more obstacles for survivors to be believed, and makes it more difficult for them to seek justice and support.  The suggestion that college campuses are full of vindictive or misguided accusers trying to take advantage of the system is simply false.  It is a societal delusion that has existed for far too long in this country and globally.  In our work as advocates, we see that the opposite is actually true - those impacted by sexual violence face significant emotional, financial, and bureaucratic burdens to filing a Title IX complaint.  Additionally, according to the Department of Justice, for every 1,000 sexual assaults only 310 are reported to police, and only six perpetrators will ever be incarcerated. \n\nWe stand proudly with survivors, and are grateful for the many University of Iowa and community partners standing alongside us.  Survivors need and deserve the full enforcement of Title IX and the \"Dear Colleague\" letter!  We've come too far to go back.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nAdam Robinson\nExecutive Director\nRape Victim Advocacy Program\nUniversity of Iowa","547":"I am writing as a professional in the sexual violence prevention field. I have a Master of Public Health and 7 years of experience specifically in campus sexual violence prevention. \n\nI believe that the Title IX guidance from the DOE, while needing some improvement, should NOT be rescinded entirely. From my experience, schools that were struggling to implement the current guidance were most often due to the \"growing pains\" of learning new guidance (it takes time for any system to effectively implement new guidance), or it was a reflection upon the staff at that university (a lack of training and\/or poor decision-making by individuals). I want to protect the rights of complainants and respondents at universities, and this can be done without completely overhauling the current guidance. \nI want to share my thoughts regarding the \"preponderance of evidence\" standard for campus proceedings. \n\nFirst, sexual assault reporting is incredibly low, both to police and to campus officials. (See http:\/\/bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov\/content\/pub\/pdf\/rsarp00.pdf and https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/pdffiles1\/nij\/grants\/221153.pdf) \n\nOf the few sexual assaults that are reported to police, very few are found to be false (see https:\/\/www.nsvrc.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf). In fact, the false report rate is on par with that of other violent crimes. (We do not yet have data about the percentage of false reports to campus officials.) In my experience, false reports are also easily discovered through basic investigation.\n\nIt is also incredibly rare for perpetrators to see any consequences. When they do, it is more common that a campus gives them a \"slap on the wrist\" (removal from a club, attending an educational event, writing a paper, etc). It is rarer still for a respondent to see consequences of any weight (such as suspension or expulsion).\n\nSo, it follows that the likelihood that someone reported a sexual assault (rare) that was false (even rarer) where the respondent received consequences of any weight (rarer STILL) is incredibly low. It is especially stark when you compare these numbers to the vast number of victims\/survivors who never report their sexual assault, or who do report but never see justice (by a campus OR the criminal justice system). \n\nClearly, we still want to prevent this incredibly unlikely occurrence, and provide due process to respondents. But DOE should not remove the preponderance of evidence standard for campus sexual assault investigations.\n\nIt is considered best practice by higher education associations and professionals across the nation to use the preponderance of the evidence standard for campus adjudication processes, because the consequences for being found \"responsible\" by a university are much different from that of being found \"guilty\" by the criminal justice system. As stated above, the consequences handed down by a university are typically mild. Even in the case of expulsion, which does create some obstacles for a student, very few actually have \"sexual assault\" stated as the reason for their expulsion on their transcripts.\n\nBy contrast, the criminal justice system has much more serious consequences, such as fines, jail, or prison. In this case, using the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard makes sense because the stakes are much higher.\n\nAs stated by current Title IX guidance, it should also be considered a form of discrimination to utilize a higher standard of proof for sexual assault cases than for other civil rights violations. Raising the standard of proof would considerably hinder the already rare ability of a university to bring perpetrators to justice and keep their campus safe; and considering that the vast majority of sexual assault victims are women, this should be considered discrimination against woman-identified students.\n\nTitle IX guidance already requires that schools provide \"an adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation.\" If there are concerns regarding this, then the Department of Education should illuminate the ways in which schools can ensure an impartial investigation (like how to provide equal resources to the complainant and respondent) while maintaining trauma-informed practices (for example, streamlining the process so the victim does not have to continually re-tell their story). An impartial process and trauma-informed practice are not at odds. \n\nAs complicated and fraught as the criminal justice system is, I also believe it would create a much larger burden on universities to ask them to move towards replicating that system, which also fails victims miserably. Moving in this direction would lead to even fewer reports than campuses see today.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly urge Secretary DeVos and the DOE to keep current Title IX Guidance, and to consult experts in higher education, victims and survivors, and advocates to learn how to improve upon that guidance. \n\nThank you for your time.","548":"Above all American Education must not discriminate against anyone.

The people who attend the various agencies for the Blind throughout the country are people trying to live independently in spite of their visual impairments.  They do not want to be wards of the government at any level nor do they want to be permanently dependent on welfare services.

It is disturbing that the regulations are being considered to be revised to potentially make them less effective. \nWe know that that females are still underrepresented in STEM fields, they are underrepresented in athletics (often based on the myth that football programs bring in money to schools, when for the vast majority of institutions, as in all but approximately four, they operate at a deficit due to the incredible expense involved in running the program). We know that sexual assault is to frequent in our schools and on our campuses. \n\nEvidence, especially over the last couple of years has demonstrated that schools and universities have been under-serving victims of sexual violence. Penn State being an example of institutional cover-up. The increased effort to enforce the regulations over the last couple of years has finally brought about some efforts at institutional change. \n\nI am urging the Department of Education not to repeal, replace, or modify current civil rights regulations. The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents, such as the guidance on: sexual harassment (including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence) ; racial and disability-based harassment; access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical education; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners.\n\nFederal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex (Title IX); race, color and national origin (Title VI); and disability (Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).

","557":"As a member of a Fraternity at the University of Denver, among other labels, I think that the actions to reduce Title IX are very negative to all of the progress that has been made on reducing sexual assault on college campuses.  My school has been making great progress around the issues of sexual assault through education, prevention, and events such as Into the Light, a student led organizations working to bring the conversation of sexual assault to light.  It is wrong that statistics I hear tell me that 1 in 4 women are subjects of sexual assault, and 1 in 20 men.  We should not be living in a society that is okay with this.  Title IX is a fantastic step towards reducing these numbers, punishing the negative actions that some men and women take towards others, and preventing a continuation of such negative actions.  I have seen many sides of sexual assault.  I have seen so called friends be removed from my school because of their actions, sexual assault.  I was asked to testify on his behalf and I did not.  I did not know the whole story, only he and the girl did, but regardless Title IX was there to defend the girl that was assaulted and he was removed from our University.  Yet I don't think that is enough.  What lessons did he learn from that?  Merely being removed isn't enough.  People that sexually assault other people should be educated to a deeper understanding so that that behavior does not exist anymore.  Most sexual assaults are done by individuals that have done it before, and they continue to do it.  I have started to work with my Fraternity members to educate them on sexual assault.  Using programs like Into the Light, Green Light Go, and our campuses Center for Advocacy, Prevention, and Education has empowered me to do more.  This issue should not be silenced and we need legislation like Title IX to stay.  Without it, we will be taking a huge step back on a big issue.  Safety is a right that everyone should have.  It is the government's job to keep its citizens safe and by wanting to reduce Title IX, I believe that our government is then not performing successfully at their job.  Care for people, care for victims, believe victims, and do more.

Because of them, survivors feel more comfortable coming forward to seek accommodations and justice for the crime that's been committed against them. Despite the guidelines and protections, the survivors I've worked with still undergo a brutal, exhausting process when they choose to go forward with a judicial hearing. This this process is far from easy, in part because the school I worked at strived to ensure equitable treatment for both the survivor and the accused; there was not a single case I worked on in which the due process rights of the accused students were violated. While that may not be the case at every university, such an occurrence would suggest that there must be a better federal oversight of the law's implementation, not that the laws currently in place are an inherent violation of an accused student's rights. \n\nI've also never worked on a case in which the survivor was found to be lying about their experience. Statistics from the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) and Department of Justice suggest that false accusations of sexual assault are exceedingly rare, between 2 and 8 percent. To base policy decisions off of statistically improbable occurrences is to create policy that's meant to protect accused students over survivors, and to further the systemic inequity that the 2011 Dear Colleague letter was supposed to start addressing. \n\nFurther, the argument that universities should not adjudicate serious crimes on their own is unfounded. Colleges' and universities' ability to sanction students for policy violations that constitute a legal crime predates Title IX. Additionally, under Title VII employers are allowed to conduct their own investigations of sexual harassment complaints and issue sanctioning (which can often include firing the accused employee), pointing to legal precedent for institutions conducting their own adjudication processes and determining appropriate sanctioning. \n\nSexual misconduct cases are often dismissed as \"he said, she said,\" but I've found that it's extremely rare for a survivor to go through with a judicial process without any kind of hard evidence to support their experience; I've never been in the situation where an accused student was found responsible based off of a reporting student's testimony alone. Because sanctioning on college campuses for sexual misconduct violations is so much more lenient than criminal sanctioning, using the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining responsibility is a sound decision. \n\nI've listened to recordings of some of the testimony from \"Men's Rights\" groups that have helped inform your opinion on this issue, and I'm incredibly disheartened that you've chosen to give the voices of rapists any weight in this discussion. Many of the men interviewed lamented the idea that being found responsible for sexual misconduct \"ruined their lives,\" and I urge you to consider that it was neither the survivor nor the university's process that ruined their lives; rather, it was their decision to rape another person. We cannot keep excusing perpetrators of sexual assault from being held responsible for the crimes they commit. Change will only come if perpetrators are held responsible for their actions, and if we create a system in which sexual assault is treated as the inexcusable crime it is.  \n\nSecretary DeVos, it is your responsibility to enforce federal laws that protect the rights of all students, including survivors. While you may feel that lending credence to the voices of accused students is, in fact, protecting their rights, that feeling proves unfounded and misguided in both the research literature and the experiences of advocates on-campus. If you go forward with rescinding the provisions outlined in Title IX and the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, you will forever bare the legacy of being the person who sacrificed protecting survivors in order to stand beside rapists. You will be personally responsible for allowing countless rapists to walk free, while condemning countless survivors to suffer in silence and live in fear. You get to decide what you want to go down in history for; I hope you make the right choice. \n\nSincerely, \nKim Johnson \n","568":"The New Hampshire Violence Against Women Campus Consortium Statement on Title IX:\nWe believe that every student deserves to learn in an environment that is safe and free from harassment and abuse. We acknowledge and respect that there are some victims who do not wish to engage with the criminal justice system, and that the criminal justice system is limited in its ability to implement immediate safety measures on campus. Schools have the ability to act immediately to make adjustments to class schedules, living arrangements, and other aspects of campus life that are essential to a student's ability to learn and feel safe. Allowing schools to continue to intervene in this way is in the best interest of all students.\n \nIt is critical that we do not limit survivors' options and that we continue to provide schools with the tools necessary to maintain a safe learning environment for all of their students. This includes the ability to make accommodations as well as to utilize a safe and equitable process to determine if a campus policy was violated, and, if so, what steps need to be taken to restore the survivor's sense of safety and protect their campus community.  \n \nIt is important for schools to understand that they are not alone in working to combat sexual violence on their campus. We recommend universities and colleges reach out to service providers in their community to bolster their prevention efforts, to strengthen their response to sexual misconduct, to connect students to support services, and to ensure that policies and procedures are both equitable and sensitive to the needs of survivors.\n \nWe encourage institutions of higher education, supporting organizations, and students to weigh in on the effectiveness of Title IX during the public comment period, which ends on September 20th.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n The New Hampshire Violence Against Women Campus Consortium is a statewide collaborative of New Hampshire colleges, universities, and professionals working collectively to develop and implement strategies to end interpersonal violence on NH's campuses.

All students need and deserve an education and protection from prejudice-based abuse, regardless of the family they were born into or the conditions they were born with. It is not only in their interest but in the public interest that all children get an education and fair treatment in school.  That is why I am urging the Department of Education not to repeal, replace, or modify current civil rights regulations. \n\nThe Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents, such as the guidance on: sexual harassment and sexual violence; racial and disability-based harassment; access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical training; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners.

She was emotionally destroyed by this and had a hard time attending school for months after, let alone attending the same school as her rapist. He, like most rapists, did not spend a day in jail for what he did to her.

Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\nOur nations education laws, upheld by the courts and regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned\nto create unified federal policy, provide the strong basis for U.S. public schools to promote and uphold\nequity and access to a public education for Americas children. These laws came about because of\nwidespread discrimination that was confronted by strong citizen activism and court cases brought by\nindividuals facing discrimination. Millions of students and their families rely on these laws to ensure\ntheir child is provided a free, appropriate, public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment.\nCongress has also authorized federal agencies to help put laws into effect by creating and enforcing\nregulations.

This process, called Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM),\nThe Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc.\nProtecting the Legal and Civil Rights of Students with Disabilities and Their Families\n2\nwhich lists any proposal in the Federal Register (FR), is the process by which members of the public\ncan consider the proposed regulation and send in comments.\nGiven our focus on educational rights, COPAA strongly recommends that ED maintain all regulation,\njoint regulation and guidance related to the following laws:\n The Civil Rights Act of 1964\n The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), currently known as the Every Student\nSucceeds Act (ESSA)\n Education Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX)\n The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\n The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)1\n The Higher Education Act (HEA)\n The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act (WIOA)\n The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act (PERKINS)\n Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\nWe especially wish to point out that Congress, over the last 15 years, has consistently sought to create\nand strengthen alignment among and between federal education laws so that all students can be held to\nthe same standards and given equitable access to a high-quality education that leads to post-secondary\ncareer training and\/or college enrollment. This holds true for all related regulations and guidance\npertaining to these laws. In fact, prior to 2002, students with disabilities were not included in state\nassessment and accountability systems; however, because of Congress actions to align ESEA\/ESSA\nand IDEA, more students with disabilities have been afforded the opportunity to learn and master\ngrade level academic content and graduate high school with a regular diploma. The WIOA has also\nbeen intentionally aligned to the IDEA [and ESSA] by Congress to assure that workforce readiness is a\ngoal for youth with significant disabilities so that they have access to competitive integrated\nemployment, as defined by statute and interpreted through regulation, and can achieve greater\neconomic self-sufficiency and independence. This iterative and intentional work must be left intact.\nThorough regulations [and concurrent guidance] help to ensure the implementation of the IDEA as\nwell as reinforces existing legal protections under all other civil rights and education laws.

Schools will not be required to provide accommodations and resources for survivors. What is the punishment if they don't provide resources? Within the current system, schools are penalized if they are not compliant with Title IX, and this ensures that schools AT LEAST have bare minimum support and resources for survivors. \n2. Perpetrators will not be treated more justly. Rather, perpetrators already benefit in the current system, so rescinding Title IX guidance will only create a climate conducive to perpetrators. Perpetrators will feel that they are going to be less scrutinized, and that sexual violence is not of utmost importance. This will foster rape culture, and further hurt those who have already been hurt. \n3. On a personal note, Devos' plans for Title IX will undo countless hours of work aimed at creating safe campuses. We would not retract guidance on murder policies on campus, so why is it even a question to soften policies on sexual violence investigations? \n\nSecretary Devos, I implore you to do your research.

The majority of the victims we have served, struggle with the decision to report because they will be opening their personal life for the public to see.  We inform them of the court process and they worry that they will be believed.  Because sexual assault Impacts their memory, they may gain additional memories and when they do others believe they are lying and their testimony is discredited.

MARO appreciates the opportunity for such input.  Representing Michigan's statewide network of mission driven organizations promoting community access and inclusion, we embrace the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act's (WIOA) intent to improve federal workforce development programs and provide new opportunities to advance economic self-sufficiency for millions of Americans with and without disabilities. \n\nWithin this context, I am writing to request replacement and modification of a regulatory overreach that is causing a significant negative impact on people with disabilities in Michigan and across the country. Our concern involves the Department of Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration's (RSA) overly restrictive interpretations and guidance to the field that are preventing people with disabilities in Michigan from accessing high paying jobs with benefits made available through the federal AbilityOne Program. \n\nIn July 2016, the Department of Education issued regulations and associated comments in support of WIOA that included additional, more restrictive, criteria to the definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" (34 CFR361.5(c)(9)(ii) (81 FR 55629 (Aug.19, 2016))). This guidance includes what amounts to a regulatory \"re-definition\" of competitive integrated employment that is neither a part of the WIOA law nor does it reflect the intent of Congress. The guidance eliminates employment options and choice for individuals with disabilities. \n\nThe re-definition targets the AbilityOne Program and participating non-profit agencies across the country as ineligible to be considered competitive integrated employment settings simply because they affirmatively hire persons with disabilities. Moreover, the guidance being promulgated by RSA strips persons with significant disabilities of their choice of career paths - specifically, those who express an interest in becoming employed or receiving supports to maintain employment, of state vocational rehabilitation (VR) support.\n\nCulver \/ Malawer - Page 2\n\nThe AbilityOne Program is the largest source of employment in the United States for individuals who are blind or have significant disabilities, and AbilityOne employment includes full prevailing wages and benefits and significant career advancement opportunities. In the State of Michigan, over 2,000 individuals are employed on AbilityOne contracts, in positions where workers, with or without disabilities, perform the same work, are held to the same performance standards, and have the same opportunities for advancement. In a recent year, total AbilityOne wages paid exceeded $26 million, and the average hourly wage in Michigan is $12.68. Michigan's Set Aside program, ensconced in State Law (PA 372-2010) to advance the employment of people with disabilities, also provided nearly 300 jobs and paid $2.6 million in wages.  These jobs are vital to the people who choose them, to their families, to their communities, and to the economy.  This choice should be restored.\n\nDue to RSA's presumption and its sub-regulatory FAQs released on January 18, 2017, Michigan's state VR agencies, Michigan Rehabilitation Services (MRS) and Bureau of Services for Blind Persons (BSBP), have ceased placing individuals receiving VR services in AbilityOne or State Set Aside jobs, presuming instead that these jobs are not sufficiently \"integrated.\" MRS and BSBP also will no longer fund critical training for these individuals if the training is likely to lead to an AbilityOne job.  This decision adversely affects people with disabilities in Michigan, and is inconsistent with the Congressional intent of WIOA.  The disconnect between federal law designed to create employment opportunities for people with disabilities, and the subsequent guidance prohibiting VR agencies from supporting jobs created for people with disabilities should be addressed.\n\nThe Department of Education should replace the regulatory guidance issued through the above-referenced the FAQs, and RSA should advise the State VR offices that AbilityOne jobs and State Set-Aside jobs presumptively do qualify as competitive integrated employment.  In addition, the Department and RSA should modify guidance to State VR offices to take an expansive view as to what qualifies as competitive integrated employment - and truly evaluate each setting on a case-by-case basis, inclusive of those provided through community rehabilitation programs.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nTodd W.

When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nMy son Nicasio has been a special education student with disabilities, within Anne Arundel County Public Schools for six years and has only made minimal improvements in his subjects. His hard work and efforts to try and keep pace with his peers are very stressful for him. He experiences episodes of anxiety if he begins to fall behind his peers, even with the supports of his Individualized Education Program. I am not convinced the the inclusive classroom model is appropriate for our Maryland special education students within Maryland Public Schools. Many school systems have updated their special education instruction models and rejected the inclusive classroom model, due to lack of improvement by many students. My son has experienced many times when he has been made to feel bullied, less than his peers and left out by his school community. I advocate for my son's rights to an equal education that includes his social\/emotional needs as well as his educational needs. Special education students deserve equal treatment and respect for their civil rights. Too often those rights, guaranteed to them under federal and state law, are violated on the local and county school level(s). As parents, we find ourselves being over matched at the special education meeting table by school system lawyers and administrators too focused on cost saving measures, and not focused enough on the education of their special education students. We are seen as a problem, rather than part of the solution. Our local school system treats our input and recommendations as hindrances to the process, rather than ways toward real progress in education. We need to learn from each other and help to support each others children, for that is how we grow the future of this country.  \n\nOur children deserve better! We can do better, we must do better.\nTogether as one people! The founding fathers intended our country and its future to include everyone. \nPlease help to support our children, and support our cause as parents and advocates for all students.\n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all children.

Details on language and reasoning for these regulatory changes are detailed in the attachment to comments. CALCASA is the technical assistance and training provider for 84 rape crisis centers in California, as well as the founding member of Raliance, a long time service provider and collaborator with campus programs throughout the United States, and a California and national voice for survivors of sexual assault. Just a few short years ago, Title IX was seriously under-utilized and under-enforced.  Survivors of sexual assault on and around campus were silenced, ignored, and chastised.  Sexual violence was an accepted social norm on many campuses.  Students and advocates organized to shine a light on this unacceptable state and many survivors came forward with similar stories of schools ignoring sexual harassment and sexual violence, or shared experiences of schools having largely inappropriate and useless processes for handling grievances. As a nation, we cannot go back to these dark ages of ignoring sexual harassment on campus and failing to create safe and healthy school systemsfrom Kindergarten to graduate school.  Now is the time to preserve valuable gains in how sexual harassment is taken seriously in schools throughout the nation.","616":"I am disappointed and shocked that the Department of Education is considering implementing new Title IX rule process, this is a clear move backwards for victims.  At present, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually assaulted while in college. Yet, fewer than 10% of sexual assault victims on college campuses report the assault. Any changes in current protections that would make it more difficult for survivors to report or to be believed will have a chilling impact on already low reporting rates. Victims need support and to let their voices be heard and know that the Department of Education will not tolerate or accept illegal behavior against them.  Victims need to know that they are safe, individuals need to know they are safe and that they will not victimized for actions taken against them.  \n\nTitle IX and the Clery Act are effective tools to support survivors, increase institutional transparency, hold individual offenders accountable and improve community safety.  It is not the role of victims or community or the Department of Education to protect offenders -they choose to hurt and choose to abuse.  It is our role to hold offenders accountable and assist them in getting the help they need to not repeat the behavior.  Changing the process will not support these actions. \n\nThe Department of Education's Title IX sexual assault guidance and the Clery Act with Campus SaVE amendments are critically important tools for addressing campus sexual harassment and assault.  There is no reason to change this to best support victims.  As an Executive Director of The Alliance, an agency that supports victims of sexual violence, it is essential that responses to campus sexual assault support survivors, uphold current available protections and improve prevention.  The campus disciplinary proceedings should use a standard of evidence no higher than preponderance of the evidence.\n\nI believe that the Department of Education will listen to the facts, the research, the experts, the victims moving forward in the intent to create a new Title IX rule process and realize this is not the right course of action.

I work with schools and districts around Title I of the ESEA; and with companies all over the country, around the federal education space. I'm an expert in child poverty, evidence-based education and school improvement. Most recently, I was the bureau chief over federal programs for a state Department of Education, from which I left to start my own firm. I wanted to get a law degree to be on an equal footing with school board attorneys, most of whom have no idea of federal law (they are generally experts inhuman resources and sometimes contracts). When it comes to federal law - whether it be IDEA, \nESEA, or charter schools - they are lost. Being attorneys, however, they tend to prefer the advice of other attorneys, not simply Ph.D.s with a lot of experience.\n\nAs a small business owner, I obviously cannot shut down my practice of education consulting for the 3 years it would take to attend law school full-time. I do not live within reasonable driving distance of any part-time law program (the closest is about 3 hours). Since part-time law degrees generally involve classes several nights each week, this isn't feasible either without moving my family. We live in a rural county.\n\nI chose Concord Law School, a California school (California is the only state that allows online law students to sit for the bar exam). When choosing Concord, I did my homework. I researched bar passage rates, read online reviews of the school, and had an attorney check out the feasibility of obtaining a California law degree in order to practice federal law. I was fully aware that only California allowed law students from non-ABA accredited law schools to take the bar. Concord made it very clear to me through numerous disclosures that the degree I would earn would entitle me to take only the California Bar. \n\nHowever, ED's gainful employment regulation, because it is overly broad and overinclusive, prevents Florida students from enrolling - because the end result will not be the ability to sit for the state bar. I plan to practice Federal law, which does not require that I be barred in any specific state. \n\nI scored high enough on the entry exam to earn a scholarship. I am not using Federal student loans (or any loans) to pay for my books or my tuition. It is a business expense. Without an online option, I have no way of earning a juris doctorate. \n\nPlease reconsider adding some \"informed consent\" or other options to this regulation so that it does not prevent those of us who enter nontraditional alternatives by choice, and who will not be harmed by these choices, from pursuing such educational avenues.","620":"There need to be more options for sexual assault victims. As it stands now, our resources on campuses are here to help and make students feel safe. ","621":"The Florida Council Against Sexual Violence (FCASV) supports the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter which reinforces protections for student victims of sexual violence.  All students have a right to an education free from sexual violence and harassment. \n\nRape has profound lifelong effects on victims; studies have shown, however, that offenders frequently perpetrate rape with impunity.  It is important for schools to understand the reality of rape and its impact on victims.  The incidence of significant consequences is high for survivors of sexual violence and includes high rates of PTSD, depression, and drug or alcohol abuse, which can hamper both their ability to succeed in school and future employment. It is estimated that one-in-five women will be raped during her college career, and six percent of men will be victims of completed or attempted sexual assault. However, only a small percentage of these cases are reported, sanctioned by campus judicial boards, or prosecuted, allowing offenders, who will often have multiple victims, to go without punishment as well as creating an unsafe environment for students. Rape is not the result of a bad hook-up.  Most rape is premeditated, predatory, and committed by a perpetrator whom the victim knows and, often, trusts.\n  \nThe decision to report to law enforcement, in addition to making a report on campus, should remain the victim's alone.  The National Alliance to End Sexual Violence and Know Your IX conducted an internet survey in March 2015. Almost 90% of survivors responded \"yes,\" they should retain the choice whether and to whom to report. When asked their concerns if reporting to police were mandatory, 79% said, \"this could have a chilling effect on reporting,\" while 72% were concerned that \"survivors would be forced to participate in the criminal justice system\/go to trial.\"  The campus process provides survivors with a reporting option that is less intimidating and often more victim-friendly than the criminal justice process. It takes place on their campus, not in a courtroom, and they have a voice in the sanctioning process. Survivors often choose this option over the criminal process because it is less punitive and more educational; it provides survivors the ability to hold their perpetrator accountable for their actions while possibly educating the perpetrator on a level that may not occur in a criminal court.  Finally, campuses should be required provide students with access to confidential advisers through partnerships with local sexual assault programs, to receive services from experienced advocates.\n\nIn instances where a victim reports both on campus and to law enforcement, the investigations and dispositions should proceed apart from each other.  Campus and criminal proceedings have purposes separate from each other and progress along different timelines.  The campus disciplinary process exists to ensure a victim is not robbed of their education as a result of sexual violence; the criminal justice process exists to protect the state.  Further, criminal proceedings often last years - potentially years after either the accuser or the accused, or both, have graduated.  This difference is critical to the importance of maintaining separate processes; to require students to wait years for campus proceedings to resolve pending disposition in the criminal justice process will surely have the effect of interfering in victims' right to an education, as Title IX prohibits.  Students deserve a safe, prompt and equitable resolution to campus disciplinary proceedings in order to complete their education without these proceedings lingering in the background.  \n\nThe guidance from the Dear Colleague Letter ensures that accusers, as well as accused, equitably benefit from due process protections. The guidance requires that each party is allowed an adviser of their choosing through the disciplinary process; receives notification of meetings at which one or the other may be present; receives simultaneous notification of the results of the proceeding, as well as information about appeal procedures; and receives timely and equal access to information that will be used during informal and formal disciplinary meetings and hearings. \n\nFinally, the Title IX requirement of a preponderance of the evidence standard is consistent with the standard of proof required in most cases throughout the civil justice system, including in other federal cases involving civil rights violations such as Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  To require a higher standard of proof for sexual violence cases than in other cases of discrimination will be anathema to the Department of Education's mission to ensure equality in education.\n\nOn behalf of survivors and programs providing direct services to victims, FCASV strongly supports the Dear Colleague Letter as it clarifies Title IX's intended purpose of protecting all students from sexual violence and harassment. \n","622":"The current administrations attitudes regarding victims and the life changing violence they have been subjected to is disgusting and perpetuates a culture of violence against women, shame, and silence. The fact that this administration is more concerned with the impact on the accused rapist or person who perpetuated the violence and crime is shameful. Why don't we instead focus more on justice for victims whose bodies have been violated, whose lives have been irrevocably changed. We should always believe the victims and seek to provide them with justice and anything else we can. We should not be seeking to protect violent criminals. We should be seeking to protect our most vulnerable members of our society. ","623":"I am speaking as the director of non-profit Day Training and Habilitation program that is licensed by the Department of Human Services in MN as well as meeting all of the certification requirements to maintain a 14c Special Wage Certificate. We complied with all WIOA requirements during this first year and did not find the process helpful or meaningful. In contrast, we heard from many frustrated and upset Legal Representatives about the process. There were nearly 200 Legal Reps for persons enrolled in our program who attended the required WIOA Career Counseling, Information and Referral meetings and not a SINGLE one reported that it was beneficial or meaningful.  \nFirst of all ... these teams (which include the client\/worker, their Legal Representative and County Case Manager) all point out that they have all talked about\/discussed\/explored the options for community based employment over the many many years they have been receiving services. This meeting requirement doesn't bring up anything NEW to the team as this discussion has always been a requirement outlined in our licensing standards so it's a duplicative process. The career counseling meetings required legal reps to often take time out of their own work day, travel a significant distance to watch a 10 minute power point on the benefits of employment in a competitive and integrated setting. Early on there were some teams that were indeed intrigued and indicated that YES -- they are interested.  What they subsequently learned was that the presentation was very misleading in how it was presented as these folks thought the entity offering the counseling were also there to HELP them in securing and sustaining the competitive employment. Well, they learned quickly that wasn't the case. What it required was yet another special team meeting where the representative from the counseling session would attend and report that the person said YES and then they essentially wash their hands of things. The person, their Legal Rep and County Case Manager are in the same situation as they've been for years ... if competitive, integrated employment was viable and feasible for the person then it has been addressed for years and years and the required WIOA Counseling session does nothing to provide additional resources or supports. These team members then get angry and frustrated and feel mislead by the process that wasted their time and gave them false hopes. \nNow they are learning that they need to repeat the entire process this year and in subsequent years. I would strongly recommend that at the very least this requirement be a 'one and done' meeting that is documented.  Better yet, incorporate the requirement into the ANNUAL team meetings that we must have as a condition of licensure within our state.  If it must be a separate counseling session that consists of nothing more than watching a misleading power point presentation then at least develop an option for Legal Representatives to complete the requirement on line or via fax or mail rather than taking time away from work with unnecessary travel time.\n\nAs a 14C Special Wage Certificate holder we are also required to provide information on the special wages offered for work based upon a persons productivity when a person enrolls in the program. This is discussed by the team on an annual basis. These wages are based upon prevailing wages for an experienced worker in our community and are evaluated on an annual basis and also submitted to the Department of Labor for review and renewal of the certificate.  Not everyone is able to work at the same pace or productivity level as an experience worker doing a similar job in the community making minimum wage or higher. The 14c Special Wage certificate allows individuals who can't maintain that level of productivity to engage in meaningful paid work and to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment --- even if that means they worked at 40% of what the worker making minimum wage in the community makes. Yes, they are paid less but they are paid a FAIR wage based upon what they are physically or cognitively capable of doing in relation to the prevailing wage analysis the DOL requires. We believe strongly that it's important to retain this option for the clients who have more significant challenges as it affords them the opportunity to engage in paid work at whatever level\/pace\/productivity level they are capable of --- which can vary hour by hour and day to day. A community based employer is not going to be tolerant of that. \n\nLet's redirect all of the time, energy, money that is being spent on imposing the required annual Career Counseling (2x a year if you are just starting to work under the special wage certificate) and build up job placement and ongoing supports for those folks who REALLY WANT the option to work competitively in the community  - who chose this option - and who would benefit from the ongoing supports.

When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nWithin the system, I personally witnessed severe prejudice, bigotry, and hatred, with highly destructive effects, directed against those with disabilities and those of minority ethnicity. Targeted individuals were ridiculed, not taken seriously, and their needs were not met. Some were physically abused.\n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all children. America should be a place where every child, no matter their unique challenges, their unique needs, or where they come from, can grow up to be what they dream.\n \nSincerely,\nKenneth Ruby, M.D.","636":"These 299 constituents representing New York join with the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in urging the U.S. Department of Education to protect Title IX, preserve all of its current regulations and guidance, and fully enforce the law. \n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.

IDEA, 20 U.S.C.  1414(d)(1)(B)(vi) and the regulations, 30 C.F.R.  300.321(a)(6) and (c)allows parents and school district-at their discretion-to include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent's right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings. Parent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom: Letter to Mamas (2004) This letter must be rescinded. As stated above, Congress has repeatedly found that \"the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by ... strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home.\" 601(C)(5). To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with\/support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom. To fully participate as members of the IEP team, they should have the right to observe the child's education in progress, a proposed placement, whether accommodations and services are being provided, and other matters. Independent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator. Letter to LaDolce (2007);  This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C.F.R. 300.503(c) requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations (IEE). While the agency [state\/district] may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation (34 C.F.R 300.502(a)(2)), the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the child's IEP.Failure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504. Letter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996):  This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they \"would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements.\" This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.Sincerely, Angela Gowans\n","668":"I am commenting on: Regulation ID: ED-2015-OSERS-001-1167 Date Posted: Aug 19, 2016 RIN:1820-AB70\nCFR:34 CFR Parts 361, 363, and 397 Federal Register Number: 2016-15980\n\nIntegrated AbilityOne (JWOD) employment that includes full wages, benefits and promotional opportunities\nmust be included in the definition of Competitive Integrated Employment\n\nThe Rehabilitation Services Administration regulatory  arbitrary re-definition of Competitive Integrated Employment;\n Restricts access to quality competitive, integrated jobs for people with significant disabilities.\n Is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, longstanding practice and technical guidance, and Congressional intent; \n Limits the ability of state Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program counselors to best determine the needs\nand competitive job fit for their individual clients with significant disabilities.\n Discriminates against non-profit employers of people with significant disabilities.\n Must be revised.\n\nSelected excerpts overreach on defining the \"typically found in the community\" component of Competitive\nIntegrated Employment and discriminate against non-profit employers (Community rehabilitation providers) of\npersons with disabilities.\n\nFederal Register\/Vol. 81, No. 161\/Friday, August 19, 2016\/Rules and Regulations.

When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws. \n\nI have spent the past 8 years working with students who are English Language Learners, most of those being immigrants. In order to ensure that all our children receive a good education and become productive citizens in their communities, you must support public education and the civil rights laws.\n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all children. America should be a place where every child, no matter their unique challenges, their unique needs, or where they come from, can grow up to be what they dream.\n\nSincerely,\nPamela J.

Schools should not handle sexual assault cases. Yes, a school is obligated to respond to sexual violence; however, that response should be to assist the complainant in seeking medical attention, preserving evidence, filing a police report. In cases of incapacitated, force, coercion, that would result in proper punishment for perpetrator. Numerous He Said, She said cases. 90% of cases where both man and woman drunk, their inhibitions were down, there were no witnesses, it happened in one of their dorm rooms. Many times the complainant refuses to seek health support or the police which directly hampers school's ability to immediately and appropriately respond. When this happens, there is no evidence, or too much time has past for the witness statements to be relevant. Under F-1, please know that adequate, reliable, impartial investigations are NOT done. Investigations are often times poorly done, the investigator is told by the school's board to with bias create the file to benefit the \"victim.\"The respondent is considered guilty until proven innocent. The investigative file is sloppy, poorly written. No recorded transcripts allowed. Both the respondent and complainant are limited to what questions the investigator asks. Edited statements for her only. The prompt time frame is never followed. F-1 is outrageous Preponderance of Evidence standard. Sexual assault is a criminal offense and should have the same standard of due process. This is why schools have NO BUSINESS holding hearings to determine responsibility for sexual assault. F-2 it's not incarceration is inappropriate! However, for many wrongfully accuse respondents OR the 90% of cases where the complainant and respondent were both drunk and had regrettable sex, the result for the respondent is a life crushing expulsion from college which though is not incarceration, is a very damaging blow to his life path. The most frequently occurring cases are where the man and woman agreed to have sex, but then for some reason she \"wasn't really into it\" and the next thing you know the man has an assault charge against him. Many of these cases involve regret on her part, or the realization mid-act that she really \"doesn't want to be doing this.\" In many of these cases, withdrawal of consent is NOT given. She might be thinking it in her head, but she does NOT actively withdraw consent. In F-6, OCR should absolutely allow cross examination of a witness. Often the woman just has her friends be her witness (though in reality there were no witnesses to the actual encounter) and her friends simply tell the investigator whatever the complainant told them to say. Again, the ramifications to the respondent are too big to not allow cross examination of witnesses. The guidance of H-2 is ridiculous because most schools knee-jerk expel the respondent immediately if found responsible. OCR should mandate now that a knee-jerk expulsion is discriminatory as each case needs to be handled individually. Under J-4, please know that NOWHERE on a campus is there information for the men that if you have regrettable sex one day, you could end up being expelled the next day. Posters are only geared toward the \"victim.\" When men get Title IX violation letters, they don't even know what the school is talking about! For every \"victim\" poster that a school puts up, another poster should be required that tells the men to not have sex with that drunk girl, because it could ruin your life! Also, please know that many women on campuses these days are equally as into it as the men. One night stands are very common on campuses, especially where lots of alcohol consumption takes place. In all, this Q&A letter from OCR is out of touch with the reality of what is happening on campuses these days. Men are accused, sometimes wrongfully, but often times in a state of confusion from the woman who didn't really \"have a good time\" and the school and her friends have convinced her that she was assaulted. A completely bias investigation is done. Man has to hire lawyer. A hearing board is convened of members fully aware that the directive from the school board is to find all alleged respondents guilty. Man is not allowed to talk directly with the complainant (though many are He said, She said), no cross- examination of the witnesses. A preponderance of evidence standard is used. Man is almost always found responsible, each hearing treated the same. He is knee-jerk expelled. He files an OCR complaint that he was discriminated against during the process. He might sue the school. More lawyer fees. Woman goes back to class. Rescind this letter and write a whole new policy on how schools should handle Title IX sexual assault cases which would be to immediately direct the woman to the health center and the police. If she accuses, better have good enough reason to tell police.","736":"1) Withdrawal of all the FERPA regulatory changes made to 34 CFR, Part 99 that went into effect in January of 2012 and 2) Enforcement of the statutory prohibition on assessing \"attitudes and beliefs\" of a student or their family in ESSA's state mandated assessments or in the NAEP.","737":"Withdrawal of all the FERPA regulatory changes made to 34 CFR, Part 99 that went into effect in January of 2012 and 2) Enforcement of the statutory prohibition on assessing \"attitudes and beliefs\" of a student or their family in ESSA's state mandated assessments or in the NAEP.\n\nGive us parents our rights back.","738":"Dear Ms. Malawer:\n \nI am a parent\/advocate\/attorney from YOUR CITY\/STATE. I am writing in response to the U.S. Department of Educations (ED) request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration.\n \nMy work\/role as a parent\/advocate\/attorney directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and\/or other administrative activity must be whether [the regulation\/guidance] advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students. Therefore, COPAA believes EDs narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nations education laws  students. \n\nTherefore, it is on behalf of children with disabilities in my school\/district\/state and their families that I make the following recommendations:\n1.Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws:\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX)The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\nThe Higher Education Act (HEA)\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nThe Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act (WIOA)\nThe Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act (PERKINS)Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n \nAs this relates to IDEA in particular, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 states: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation. I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\n \n2. Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n3. Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n4. Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\n \nThe letters to rescind are: Parents right to include\/invite participants to IEP meetings:    Letter to Anonymous (2003)\n   Letter to Byrd (2003)\nRationale: These letters must be rescinded. IDEA, 20 U.S.C.  1414(d)(1)(B)(vi) and the regulations, 30 C.F.R.  300.321(a)(6) and (c) allows parents and school districtat their discretionto include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent's right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings.\n\nRationale: This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements. This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.\n \nI appreciate the opportunity to comment.\n \nSincerely,\n \nMichael Gallagher\n \n\n \n\n \n\n","739":"Hi my name is David Green.

Regulations and guidance have been developed to clarify the laws in order to make sure that states, districts and schools understand what the law requires of them and to make sure that all stakeholders in the special education or 504 process understands the protections students have. In NY, parents, teachers, school administers, state legislators, our local School Board, and the NY Department of Education have worked very hard to develop a comprehensive, clear process for educating children with special needs which are predicated on the carefully crafted rules and guidance established in our federal law and associated regulations.\nMy daughter was born at 24  weeks, at 1 lb, 10 oz.  She was given 5 days to live due to the many physical issues she was born with, many of which she still deals with. With extra help at school, she made it through Mamaroneck High School, played rec soccer, traveled and enjoyed a fairly normal childhood. She went on to graduate from Concordia College in Bronxville. She is working at a non-profit and is trying to finish her first novel. IDEA and its regulations were the foundation upon which we were able to defend her rights to access the general education curriculum. \nAbleism is the word to describe discrimination based on perceived abilities. Ableism is real and creates many barriers for students and adults with disabilities. Every week we see the ugly ways in which people look upon those with disabilities based solely on their appearance or behaviors, and not based on their many achievements. Achievements which would NOT have been attained without our current federal laws and regulations which set standards toward combatting the barriers of structural ableism.\nAdvancing equitable access to public education and defending the civil rights of persons who experience disabilities creates engaged American citizens who are, according to the data, more likely to participate in our economy and their self-sufficiency. My daughter is the perfect example of a success story because of the existing, detailed regulations and laws.\nIt is the US Department of Education's responsibility to provide the clarity needed for the proper implementation of the critically important laws that they oversee.

He lives in his own apartment, co-owns a small but slowly growing artisanal bread business and has a semi independent life in the community.  IDEA and its regulations were the foundation upon which I was able to defend his rights to access the general education curriculum. \n\nWIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act) is a critical tool to ensure that others with special needs can access competitive integrated employment.  \n\nAbleism is the word to describe discrimination based on perceived abilities.  Ableism is real and creates many barriers for students and adults with disabilities.  Every week I witness the ugly ways in which people look upon my son with either charity, pity or as though he is a perpetual child based solely on his appearance despite his many achievements.  Achievements which would NOT have been attained without our current federal laws and regulations which set standards toward combatting the barriers of structural ableism.  \n\nAdvancing equitable access to public education and defending the civil rights of persons who experience disabilities creates engaged American citizens who are, according to the data, more likely to participate in our economy and their self-sufficiency.  My son is the perfect example of a success story because of the existing, detailed regulations and laws.\n\nIt is the US Department of Education's reponsibility to provide the clarification needed for the proper implementation of the critically important laws that they oversee.   With a keen focus on the most vulnerable student populations, supporting and protecting America's students should be a priority of every administration.  Again, please do not rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nThank you,\n\nLisa D.

Under JWOD, a Qualified Non Profit Agency must employ 75% people who are blind in direct labor positions [41 CFR 51-1.3]. This provision of law addressed a persistent imbalance in our society: 70% of people who are blind are unemployed. The law was intended to provide employment opportunities for this capable, yet underutilized population by creating preferential and mandatory purchasing of AbilityOne products created by qualitied nonprofit agencies by the Federal Government.  \nThe Department's regulation of 2016 created direct contradictions to this part of the law by stating that AbilityOne agencies would not \"typically be found in the community\" and thus are not considered successful employment placements under WIOA. In practice, this has led to several State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies refusing to consider jobs in AbilityOne agencies for their clients who are blind. \nThis language from the WIOA Vocational Rehabilitation rule demonstrates this inconsistency and conflict: \"The factors that generally would result in a business being considered \"not typically found in the community,\" include: (1) the funding of positions through Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (JWOD) contracts...\"\nUnder these regulations a minimum wage, part-time job at a fast food chain would be considered a successful placement, but a full-time job with good wages, health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and retirement contributions at an AbilityOne agency like Lighthouse Louisiana or Louisiana Association for the Blind would not be considered a successful outcome. This paternalistic regulation limits choice of Americans who are blind by cutting off attractive, high-quality jobs in AbilityOne agencies. \nThis regulation endangers the livelihood of people who are blind and the future of the AbilityOne Program across the nation. With this letter, I urge you to rescind regulations that ban successful employment outcomes at AbilityOne agencies.\nRenee VidrineShelly Taylor\nPresidentPresident\nLighthouse LouisianaLouisiana Association for the Blind\n","757":"Please see my uploaded comments regarding the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.\n\nSincerely, \n\nChris Burnett, Executive Director\nOregon Resource Association","758":"I am writing to urge the US Education Department to withdraw the regulation that appears at 34 CFR Part 99, which was effective January 2012 and which greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA. \n\nThe Obama regulation redefined certain statutory terms so that schools, state agencies, and the feds may now disclose personally identifiable information on students to almost anyone in the world as long as the correct terminology is used to justify the disclosure. This can be done without obtaining consent from parents or even informing them of the disclosure. \n\nThe current philosophy via this regulation that our children are data sources to be mined by government and corporations is dangerous now and in the future.

Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws: The Civil Rights Act of 1964;  ESEA\/ESSA; Education Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX); The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504); IDEA; HEA; ADA; WIOA; PERKINS; FOIA; and FERPA.\nAs this relates to IDEA in particular: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation. I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\n2. Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n3. Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n4. Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\nThe letters to rescind are:\nParents right to include\/invite participants to IEP meetings: Letter to Anonymous (2003); Letter to Byrd (2003) These letters must be rescinded. IDEA, 20 U.S.C.  1414(d)(1)(B)(vi) and the regulations, 30 C.F.R.  300.321(a)(6) and (c) allows parents and school districtat their discretionto include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent's right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings. \nParent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom: Letter to Mamas (2004) This letter must be rescinded. As stated above, Congress has repeatedly found that \"the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by  strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home. 601(C)(5). To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with\/support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom. To fully participate as members of the IEP team, they should have the right to observe the child's education in progress, a proposed placement, whether accommodations and services are being provided, and other matters. \nIndependent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator.Letter to LaDolce (2007); This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C.F.R. 300.503(c) requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations (IEE). While the agency [state\/district] may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation (34 C.F.R 300.502(a)(2)), the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the childs IEP. \nFailure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504. Letter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996):  This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements. This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment.\n\n","780":"To:  Hilary Malawer, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel\n400 Maryland Avenue SW., Room 6E231\nWashington, DC 20202\n\nRE: Docket ID: ED2017OS0074\n\nI am a parent from Riverside, CA writing in response to the U.S. Department of Educations (ED) request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration.\n\nAs a parent, on behalf of children with disabilities in Riverside Unified district in California and their families that I make the following recommendations:\n \n1.

Schools should not handle sexual assault cases. Yes, a school is obligated to respond to sexual violence; however, that response should be to assist the complainant in seeking medical attention, preserving evidence, filing a police report. In cases of incapacitated, force, coercion, that would result in proper punishment for perpetrator. Numerous He Said, She said cases. 90% of cases where both man and woman drunk, their inhibitions were down, there were no witnesses, it happened in one of their dorm rooms. Many times the complainant refuses to seek health support or the police which directly hampers school's ability to immediately and appropriately respond. When this happens, there is no evidence, or too much time has past for the witness statements to be relevant. Under F-1, please know that adequate, reliable, impartial investigations are NOT done. Investigations are often times poorly done, the investigator is told by the school's board to with bias create the file to benefit the \"victim.\"The respondent is considered guilty until proven innocent. The investigative file is sloppy, poorly written. No recorded transcripts allowed. Both the respondent and complainant are limited to what questions the investigator asks. Edited statements for her only. The prompt time frame is never followed. F-1 is outrageous Preponderance of Evidence standard. Sexual assault is a criminal offense and should have the same standard of due process. This is why schools have NO BUSINESS holding hearings to determine responsibility for sexual assault. F-2 it's not incarceration is inappropriate! However, for many wrongfully accuse respondents OR the 90% of cases where the complainant and respondent were both drunk and had regrettable sex, the result for the respondent is a life crushing expulsion from college which though is not incarceration, is a very damaging blow to his life path. The most frequently occurring cases are where the man and woman agreed to have sex, but then for some reason she \"wasn't really into it\" and the next thing you know the man has an assault charge against him. Many of these cases involve regret on her part, or the realization mid-act that she really \"doesn't want to be doing this.\" In many of these cases, withdrawal of consent is NOT given. She might be thinking it in her head, but she does NOT actively withdraw consent. In F-6, OCR should absolutely allow cross examination of a witness. Often the woman just has her friends be her witness (though in reality there were no witnesses to the actual encounter) and her friends simply tell the investigator whatever the complainant told them to say. Again, the ramifications to the respondent are too big to not allow cross examination of witnesses. The guidance of H-2 is ridiculous because most schools knee-jerk expel the respondent immediately if found responsible. OCR should mandate now that a knee-jerk expulsion is discriminatory as each case needs to be handled individually. Under J-4, please know that NOWHERE on a campus is there information for the men that if you have regrettable sex one day, you could end up being expelled the next day. Posters are only geared toward the \"victim.\" When men get Title IX violation letters, they don't even know what the school is talking about! For every \"victim\" poster that a school puts up, another poster should be required that tells the men to not have sex with that drunk girl, because it could ruin your life! Also, please know that many women on campuses these days are equally as into it as the men. One night stands are very common on campuses, especially where lots of alcohol consumption takes place. In all, this Q&A letter from OCR is out of touch with the reality of what is happening on campuses these days. Men are accused, sometimes wrongfully, but often times in a state of confusion from the woman who didn't really \"have a good time\" and the school and her friends have convinced her that she was assaulted. A completely bias investigation is done. Man has to hire lawyer. A hearing board is convened of members fully aware that the directive from the school board is to find all alleged respondents guilty. Man is not allowed to talk directly with the complainant (though many are He said, She said), no cross- examination of the witnesses. A preponderance of evidence standard is used. Man is almost always found responsible, each hearing treated the same. He is knee-jerk expelled. He files an OCR complaint that he was discriminated against during the process. He might sue the school. More lawyer fees. Woman goes back to class. Rescind this letter and write a whole new policy on how schools should handle Title IX sexual assault cases which would be to immediately direct the woman to the health center and the police. If she accuses, better have good enough reason to tell police.","831":"To:Hilary Malawer, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel \n\nRE: Docket ID: ED2017OS0074: Evaluation of Existing Regulations\nI am writing in response to the ED request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda. Any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and\/or other administrative activity must be whether [the regulation\/guidance] advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students. I agree with COPAA and believes EDs narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nations education laws  students.  \nI make the following recommendations:\n1.Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws: The Civil Rights Act of 1964;  ESEA\/ESSA; Education Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX); The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504); IDEA; HEA; ADA; WIOA; PERKINS; FOIA; and FERPA. \nAs this relates to IDEA in particular: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation. I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\n 2.Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n3.Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n4.Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\nThe letters to rescind are:\nParents right to include\/invite participants to IEP meetings: Letter to Anonymous (2003); Letter to Byrd (2003) These letters must be rescinded. IDEA, 20 U.S.C.  1414(d)(1)(B)(vi) and the regulations, 30 C.F.R.  300.321(a)(6) and (c) allows parents and school districtat their discretionto include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent's right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings. \nParent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom: Letter to Mamas (2004) This letter must be rescinded. As stated above, Congress has repeatedly found that \"the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by  strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home. 601(C)(5). To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with\/support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom. To fully participate as members of the IEP team, they should have the right to observe the child's education in progress, a proposed placement, whether accommodations and services are being provided, and other matters. \nIndependent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator. Letter to LaDolce (2007);  This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C.F.R. 300.503(c) requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations (IEE). While the agency [state\/district] may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation (34 C.F.R 300.502(a)(2)), the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the childs IEP. \nFailure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504. Letter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996):  This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements. This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.\nSincerely, Beth Tremblay Hall\n\n","832":"My concern is as written the unintended effect parts of these regulations will have on people with significant disabilities employed by MDI.

The DCL recognizes that for the Title IX process to be legitimate, it's essential that both students engage with a process that is fair and equitable. The DCL outlines the following:\n \no   Both parties must be notified in writing regarding the outcome of the complaint and their right to an appeal\no   The complaint is investigated adequately, reliably, and impartially\no   There is a designated and reasonably prompt time frame for major stages of the process\no   Universities must use the preponderance of evidence standard.

Currently, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter provides timely, necessary, and effective regulation to support universities in their responsibility to students.

I am writing in response to the U.S. Department of Educations (ED) request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration. \n\n \n\nMy work as a parent\/advocate directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and\/or other administrative activity must be whether [the regulation\/guidance] advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students.Therefore, it is on behalf of children with disabilities in my school\/district\/state and their families that I make the following recommendations:\n\n \n\n1.Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\n\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws:\n\n \n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\n\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX)\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\n\nThe Higher Education Act (HEA)\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nThe Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act (PERKINS)\n\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\n \n\nAs this relates to IDEA in particular, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 states: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation. I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\n\n \n\n2.Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n\n3.Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n\n4.Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\n\n \n\nRationale: These letters must be rescinded. IDEA, 20 U.S.C.  1414(d)(1)(B)(vi) and the regulations, 30 C.F.R.  300.321(a)(6) and (c) allows parents and school districtat their discretionto include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent's right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings. \n\n \n\nParent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom\n\n \n\nIndependent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator.\n\nLetter to LaDolce (2007)\n\nRationale: This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C.F.R. 300.503(c) requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations (IEE). While the agency [state\/district] may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation (34 C.F.R 300.502(a)(2)), the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the childs IEP. \n\n \n\nFailure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504\n\nLetter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996) \n\n Rationale: This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements. This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.\n\n \n\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\nJennifer Pedersen\n","866":"In many cases, the investigation and adjudication by the colleges following the guidelines of the Dear Colleague letters are the only justice a victim may get.

The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter affirms that: \n\no   Every school must have and distribute a policy against sexual discrimination\no   Every school must have a Title IX coordinator whose responsibilities are oversee individual complaints of sexual discrimination and act to address any patterns or systemic problems of sexual violence and sexual discrimination \no   Every school must have and make known a procedure for students to file complaints of sexual discrimination \n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter also affirms the rights of both the complainant and the respond during the university Title IX process. The DCL recognizes that for the Title IX process to be legitimate, it's essential that both students engage with a process that is fair and equitable. The DCL outlines the following: \n\no   Both parties must be notified in writing regarding the outcome of the complaint and their right to an appeal \no   The complaint is investigated adequately, reliably, and impartially \no   There is a designated and reasonably prompt time frame for major stages of the process\no   Universities must use the preponderance of evidence standard. The preponderance of evidence standard is consistent with the standard of proof established for violations of civil rights laws. \no   Both parties must have an equal opportunity to present relevant witness and other evidence. \no   Both parties must be afforded similar and timely access to any information that will be used in the Title IX hearing\no   If the university permits lawyers in the process, then both parties must have the option to choose a lawyer\no   All university personnel who are involved in the Title IX process, must have training or experience in handling complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. \n\nThe OCR must continue to investigate universities that do not adhere to these standards so that the integrity of the process is maintained. Currently, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter provides timely, necessary, and effective regulation to support universities in their responsibility to students. There is no reason to rescind the 2011 Dear Colleague letter, or the 2001 Dear Colleague Letter, when both documents provide the necessary foundation for universities to be successful in their responsibilities to students and their families.\n\nThank you.\n","867":"Dear Ms. Malawer:\n\n \n\nI am a parent and educational advocate from Belmont, MA.

This provision basically makes any reciprocity agreement null.\n\nProfessional Licensing\n\nCompliance with the professional licensure requirements may provide the biggest challenge. An institution is required to provide an individualized disclosure to a prospective student if a program does not meet licensure or certification prerequisites in a state of the student's residence. In the provisions, a prospective student is defined as someone who has been in contact with the institution and has requested information concerning admission. At an open access institution, anyone may apply and be admitted to the college simply by filling out an admission application on the institution's website. Prospective students may register and enroll without declaring a degree path, making it impossible to know the student's intent. Therefore, providing an individualized disclosure statement to a prospective student may not be feasible.

This regulation has brought sweeping changes to the career training sector.

This is a carefully targeted rule that allows good programs to persist while getting rid of those that do a poor job with students. If this regulation goes away, career training programs and schools will go back to ripping off students through low-quality programs and some will continue to engage in deliberate predatory marketing to low-income people and veterans. Leaving students in debt with an education or certificate that does not equip them to work is wrong. Students deserve protection from bad actors and predatory practices. Students deserve programs that are of high quality that will not leave them in debt and ill-equipped for employment.

When she graduated she had nothing to do, but sit at home.  She eventually started working at a sheltered workshop that allows her to work at her own pace, develop skills and she has been very successful there.  I see progress everyday!  The good thing about places like this is it allows her to contribute at the speed that she can perform.  She does not have to be pressured to do more than she is capable of.  It is the best thing that could have ever happened to her.  It gives her an incentive to get up and go each day.  She has less behavior issues since she is happy.  It keeps her occupied and gives her something to feel good about.  She would not be able to work at a regular job and keep up the pace as other workers.  With the WIOA as I understand it, a person now has to go through a long process before they can earn subminimum wage or either be 25 years old.

Give our children an uncensored and informative view of the many uses of hemp the same as we do for any other agriculture product like corn, wheat or tomatoes.

My son is a senior in high school and we discuss hemp daily at home but his high school won't allow talking about hemp. He will be less ignorant than your kids and ready for the hemp revolution.  \n\nHemp is a distinct variety of the plant species cannabis sativa L. that contains minimal (less than 1%) amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. It is a tall, slender, fibrous plant similar to flax or kenaf. Various parts of the plant can be utilized in the making of textiles, paper, paints, clothing, plastics, cosmetics, foodstuffs, insulation, animal feed and other products. According to the Congressional Research Service, the United States is the only developed nation in which industrial hemp is not an established crop.\n\nIn 2014, members of Congress approved language in the omnibus federal Farm Bill explicitly authorizing states to sponsor hemp research absent federal reclassification of the plant. Presently, a majority of US states have enacted legislation permitting licensed hemp cultivation in a manner that is compliant with this statute. \n\nIt is time to allow US farmers the opportunity to explore this emerging market without facing undue federal hurdles, and it's time to educate our students on hemp.

While it is awful to be accused of a crime one did not commit, if the recent record in American politics and popular culture points to anything, it is that powerful people can commit heinous acts, and it will largely go unpunished. Scores of wealthy and famous individuals continue to escape blame and in fact continue to garner power and accolades, while those they violate are forced to live in fear or relive their experiences. As a student on an American campus that is currently facing Title IX investigations I can confidently say that much of the sexual harassment, assault, and rape at my school goes unreported and even those that are known to the school and go through legal processes rarely end satisfactorily for survivors.

We have made tremendous progress in improving the response to campus sexual assault since the 2011 Dear Colleague letter provided institutions with a detailed process for ensuring both parties receive fair treatment, and that survivors feel more comfortable coming forward.  Repealing or modifying any of the procedures that are working well will only create a situation where survivors are forced back into the closet and are unable to get the assistance they need, while offenders continue to act with impunity on campuses.  Title IX guidance has established the foundation of a workable, effective and fair system. Implementation takes time, and there is still work to be done. The solution is to keep, and enforce, Title IX guidance, while continuing to improve upon it by: Supporting schools in development of equitable and transparent procedures; increasing participation in high-quality training; and adopting best-practices in student conduct policies, processes, prevention, and survivor care.","935":"The 2014-04-29 Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence letter from OCR should be rescinded. Schools should not handle sexual assault cases. Yes, a school is obligated to respond to sexual violence; however, that response should be to assist the complainant in seeking medical attention, preserving evidence and filing a police report. In cases of incapacitated, force, coercion, that would result in proper punishment to the perpetrator. There are numerous He Said, She said cases. 90% of cases where both man and woman were drunk, their inhibitions were down, there were no witnesses because it happened in one of their dorm rooms. Many times the complainant refuses to seek health support or the police which directly hampers the school's ability to immediately and appropriately respond. When this happens, there is no evidence, or too much time has past for the witness statements to be relevant. Under F-1, please know that adequate, reliable and impartial investigations are NOT done. Investigations are often times poorly done, the investigator is told by the school's board to with bias create the file to benefit the \"victim.\"The respondent is considered guilty until proven innocent. The investigative file is sloppy, poorly written. No recorded transcripts allowed. Both the respondent and complainant are limited to what questions the investigator asks. Edited statements for her only. The prompt time frame is never followed. F-1 is outrageous Preponderance of Evidence standard. Sexual assault is a criminal offense and should have the same standard of due process. This is why schools have NO BUSINESS holding hearings to determine responsibility for sexual assault. F-2 it's not incarceration is inappropriate! However, for many wrongfully accuse respondents OR the 90% of cases where the complainant and respondent were both drunk and had regrettable sex, the result for the respondent is a life crushing expulsion from college which though is not incarceration, is a very damaging blow to his life path. The most frequently occurring cases are where the man and woman agreed to have sex, but then for some reason she \"wasn't really into it\" and the next thing you know the man has an assault charge against him. Many of these cases involve regret on her part, or the realization mid-act that she really \"doesn't want to be doing this.\" In many of these cases, withdrawal of consent is NOT given. She might be thinking it in her head, but she does NOT actively withdraw consent. In F-6, OCR should absolutely allow cross examination of a witness. Often the woman just has her friends be her witness (though in reality there were no witnesses to the actual encounter) and her friends simply tell the investigator whatever the complainant told them to say. Again, the ramifications to the respondent are too big to not allow cross examination of witnesses. The guidance of H-2 is ridiculous because most schools knee-jerk expel the respondent immediately if found responsible. OCR should mandate now that a knee-jerk expulsion is discriminatory as each case needs to be handled individually. Under J-4, please know that NOWHERE on a campus is there information for the men that if you have regrettable sex one day, you could end up being expelled the next day. Posters are only geared toward the \"victim.\" When men get Title IX violation letters, they don't even know what the school is talking about! For every \"victim\" poster that a school puts up, another poster should be required that tells the men to not have sex with that drunk girl, because it could ruin your life! Also, please know that many women on campuses these days are equally as horny as the men. One night stands are very common on campuses, especially where lots of alcohol consumption takes place. In all, this Q&A letter from OCR is out of touch with the reality of what is happening on campuses these days. Men are accused, sometimes wrongfully, but often times in a state of confusion from the woman who didn't really \"have a good time\" and the school and her friends have convinced her that she was assaulted. A completely bias investigation is done. Man has to hire lawyer. A hearing board is convened of members fully aware that the directive from the school board is to find all alleged respondents guilty. Man is not allowed to talk directly with the complainant (though many are He said, She said), no cross- examination of the witnesses. A preponderance of evidence standard is used. Man is almost always found responsible, each hearing treated the same. He is knee-jerk expelled. He files an OCR complaint that he was discriminated against during the process. He might sue the school. More lawyer fees. Woman goes back to class. Rescind this letter and write a whole new policy on how schools should handle Title IX sexual assault cases which would be to immediately direct the woman to the health center and the police. If she accuses, better have good enough reason to tell police.","936":"To:Hilary Malawer,\n\nAssistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel\n\nU.S. Department of Education\n\n400 Maryland Avenue SW., Room 6E231\n\nWashington, DC 20202\n\n \n\nRE: Docket ID: ED2017OS0074: Evaluation of Existing Regulations\n\n \n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\n \n\nI am a parent\/advocate\/attorney from Newton, MA.

Special Education \/ Mom \/ ","938":"\nOur entire family life was devastated when our daughter was sexually assaulted by a classmate on a multi-day school field trip. The Seattle Public School Districts failure to recognize her federally mandated Title IX rights guaranteeing an equal education free of sexual harassment, to acknowledge her report of sexual assault as required, to promptly and equitably investigate, to prevent retaliation, and to treat her with basic human dignity has been life-scaring beyond description. Our efforts to hold those responsible were met with avoidance, denial, misinformation, falsification, and violations at every juncture.  See bit.ly\/1pAOo7B \n\nThe inequitable way in which the District responded to the rape of our daughter caused her to feel utterly devalued as a human being. Not only was she deceived by a classmate who assaulted her in the presence of other students, she was also betrayed by teachers and chaperones who failed to protect female students on the overnight trip. She was further betrayed by her school, which failed to implement the required steps that would have allowed her to continue her education, free of retaliation, after the assault. Instead, she was treated like a second-class citizen while a male athlete perpetrator, who had previously been disciplined for sexual misconduct, was allowed to continue his education as a valued member of the school community. This was not the first instance (or the last) that the school failed to provide a safe environment for girls on field trips.\n\nTo avoid both liability and accountability, the District disregarded its Title IX obligations and resorted to gender-based discrimination to shut down the complaint of sexual assault. By discounting the report of rape from the female victim, by adopting an inappropriate advocacy role for the perpetrator, and by repeatedly denying the negligence that put female students at risk of sexual assault, the Seattle School District fostered a culture of sexual violence. Because of this we filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which was opened in June, 2014.\n\nOur high profile case (See http:\/\/bit.ly\/1Ny9cXf) caused numerous families across the country to contact us about their students devastating cases of sexual harassment and assault, beginning in kindergarten. In all cases, schools were ignorant of their Title IX obligations to both proactively address sexual harassment\/assault, and to handle reports in accordance with Title IX. After identifying an epidemic of unchecked K-12 sexual harassment\/assault and learning that most schools are ill-prepared to lawfully address it, we formed a national nonprofit, Stop Sexual Assault in Schools (SSAIS.org). Our free resources help families compel their schools to follow Title IX.  \n\nSecretary Devos, I urge you to watch Sexual Harassment: Not in Our School!  bit.ly\/2gelE2S, to read my recent interview on the National Women's Law Center website \"Why We Need Title IX to Let Her Learn: A Parents Perspective\" (bit.ly\/2wGltpf), and watch On Point Talk interview with SSAIS co-founder, Joel Levin (bit.ly\/2ujlT5m). Your plan to rescind guidance will not only impact college students, it will weaken Title IX compliance for our most vulnerable students in K-12.  If you want to diminish college sexual violence, you must address it by changing the culture of K-12 schools, where students practice sexual harassment and assault on a daily basis. And this includes schools like the one you attended that receive federal funds. You can only address sexual harassment and assaultand all forms of sex discriminationby strengthening Title IX, not removing the guidance ALL schools urgently need. \n\nTragically, school districts have little incentive to follow Title IX.  Its imperative that you introduce measures to ensure K-12 compliance, thereby demonstrating that sexual harassment and assault wont be tolerated, diminishing the impact of sexual harassment\/assault K-12, and arresting the predatory behavior that begins in the K-12 environment and extends into colleges\/the workplace. Title IX is the law of land and you must do much more to enforce it, beginning in K-12 environment.

I am writing in response to the U.S. Department of Educations (ED) request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration. \n \nMy work as an attorney directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation, guidance, technical assistance and\/or other administrative activity must be whether it advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students. I believe EDs narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nations education laws  students.  \n\nTherefore, it is on behalf of children with disabilities in my community and their families that I make the following recommendations:\n \n1. Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws.\nI strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation, joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws:\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972 (particularly Title IX)\n-The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Particularly Section 504)\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\nThe Higher Education Act (HEA)\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nThe Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act (WIOA)\nThe Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act (PERKINS)\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n \nAs this relates to IDEA in particular, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232 states: The Secretary may not implement, or publish in final form, any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act, as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20, 1983 (particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education, least restrictive environment, related services, timelines, attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings, or qualifications of personnel), except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation. I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance.\n \n2. Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws.\n3. Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters.\n4. Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters (DCL) that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parents right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA.\n \nThe letters to rescind are:\nParents right to include\/invite participants to IEP meetings: \noLetter to Anonymous (2003)\noLetter to Byrd (2003)\n\n \nParent(s) and expert(s) right to observe [the child] in the classroom\nLetter to Mamas (2004)\n\n \nIndependent Education Evaluations (IEE): The right of the family to include recommendations [to the IEP team] from the evaluator.\n-Letter to LaDolce (2007)\nRationale: This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C.F.R. 300.503(c) requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations (IEE). While the agency [state\/district] may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation (34 C.F.R 300.502(a)(2)), the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the childs IEP. \n \n Failure to consent to IEP under IDEA should not impact eligibility for Section 504\n-Letter to McKethan, 25 IDELR 295, 296 (OCR 1996) \nRationale: This letter should be reversed because when parents reject the IEP developed under the IDEA, they would essentially be rejecting what would be offered under Section 504. The parent could not compel the district to develop an IEP under Section 504 as that effectively happened when the school followed IDEA requirements. This reasoning runs contrary to the intent of Section 504 protections.\n \nSincerely,\nStephanie Klitsch\n \n","940":"Used to withdraw the regulation that appears at 34 CFR Part 99, which was effective January  2012 which greatly diminished the privacy protections of FERPA.\nThank you","941":"The right to privacy is a hallmark of our Republic.

We knew immediately in Jan. 2012 when Obama forced \"rule by letter\" into the public schools of America that the privacy of students' information would be shattered. By redefining statutory terms, Obama succeeded in opening the floodgates to students' personally identifiable information which can now be shared with anyone who knows how to use certain terminology to justify the disclosures. Parents have no way to change incorrect information in their children's records, and those records will follow a child into adulthood. \n\nLooking back on our younger years, how many of us adults would want our entire future to be determined by something we said or did when we were eight years old; and we certainly would not want that personal information to be shared with people all over the world. \n\nPlease return the FERPA law back to its prior wording before Obama exerted his harmful overreach of the executive branch.

The man who raped me took advantage of me while I was unconscious and when I woke up to him assaulting me and pushed him off, he never apologized. \n\nI urge the Secretary and Department to maintain Title IX's current guidelines. Title IX is essential to protecting students from discrimination in recruitment, admissions, counseling, financial assistance, athletics, sex-based harassment, treatment of pregnant and parenting students, discipline, single-sex education, and employment. I especially urge the Department to protect those guidelines included the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) relating to sexual assault and violence on college campuses.\n11% of all students experience sexual assault during their time at college. College-aged female students are 20% more likely to be victims of rape or sexual assault than their non-student counterparts. 23.1% of females experience rape or sexual assault during their time as undergraduate students. These and a multitude of other statistics that I'm sure have been brought to the Department's attention bring to light only some of the issue of sexual assaults on college campuses. Title IX and the DCL guidelines are essential to keeping our college students safe and ending sexual assault on our campuses.

CSS provides work under a 14c certificate.  Participants are encouraged to work toward Competitive, Integrated Employment.

In this way people learn that focusing on a task is beneficial and can serve them well when\/if CIE becomes available.\n\nSince what I handle is inquiry and intake, I have noticed a considerable drop in calls and requests for information, tours, and 1-day orientations.

This regulation included both a policy decision and language around competitive integrated employment that are resulting in substantial harm to people who are blind.\n\nThe definition of competitive integrated employment as interpreted by the Department creates a serious inconsistency with the Javits-Wagner-ODay Act (JWOD). Under JWOD, a Qualified Non Profit Agency must employ 75% people who are blind in direct labor positions [41 CFR 51-1.3]. This provision of law addressed a persistent imbalance in our society: 70% of people who are blind are unemployed. The law was intended to provide employment opportunities for this capable, yet underutilized population by creating preferential and mandatory purchasing of AbilityOne products created by qualified nonprofit agencies by the Federal Government.  \n\nThe Departments regulation of 2016 created direct contradictions to this part of the law by stating that AbilityOne agencies would not typically be found in the community and thus are not considered successful employment placements under WIOA. In practice, this has led to several State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies refusing to consider jobs in AbilityOne agencies for their clients who are blind. \nThis language from the WIOA Vocational Rehabilitation rule demonstrates this inconsistency and conflict: The factors that generally would result in a business being considered not typically found in the community, include: (1) the funding of positions through Javits-Wagner-ODay Act (JWOD) contracts\nUnder these regulations a minimum wage, part-time job at a fast food chain would be considered a successful placement, but a full-time job with good wages, health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and retirement contributions at an AbilityOne agency like Lighthouse Louisiana or Louisiana Association for the Blind would not be considered a successful outcome. This paternalistic regulation limits choice of Americans who are blind by cutting off attractive, high-quality jobs in AbilityOne agencies. \n\nThis regulation endangers the livelihood of people who are blind and the future of the AbilityOne Program across the nation.

When properly executed, the Guidances support fair and impartial procedures that ensure that students can feel safe and supported in the aftermath of a sexual assault (or other Title IX violation).  Not only survivors but the entire school community benefits from the Guidances.  They provide direction for awareness and prevention programming, training of school personnel, equitable procedures for conducting investigations and sanctioning students, facilitation of interim measures during investigations to support both the reporting and the responding student, and the provision of accommodations after adjudication so that survivor students are more able to continue with their education. \n\nIt is important to remember that the purpose of Title IX is not to abdicate responsibility and refer violations of criminal law to law enforcement.  The purpose is to enforce the civil right to be free from discrimination based on sex within the educational institution. In our experience, for a variety of reasons, only a fraction of survivors feel safe or comfortable reporting to law enforcement. If that was the only option, student survivors would face a huge barrier to accessing remedies in the aftermath of sexual violence.  It is not the only option.

Employment of individuals with disabilities is a national priority for Easterseals, who last year provided employment services to more than 70,000 jobseekers from across the country.\n\nEasterseals Southeast Wisconsin along with other agencies and the State of Wisconsin have special contracts to maintain waysides and other state property.  These contracts provide people with disabilities great opportunities to build their skills, earn minimum wage or better and regularly interact with members of community.  These enclaves do not always have someone without a disability and the current rule may force this workforce development opportunity to go be terminated.  We need all options to help the thousands of people living with a disability to enter the competitive workforce, not create artificial restrictions on community-based employment.\n\nWe were pleased that the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) included Easterseals-supported provisions to help increase competitive integrated employment opportunities for students and adults with disabilities. WIOA Section 404 defined competitive integrated employment by establishing practical and measurable criteria related to earnings and location. For example, WIOA required that competitive integrated employment be compensated at no less than the minimum wage and performed at locations where the employee with disabilities interacts with individuals without disabilities \"to the same extent that individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with other persons.\"\n\nHowever, the Department's 2016 WIOA regulation went well beyond the congressionally agreed-upon statutory definition of competitive integrated employment by prescribing additional regulatory sub-requirements. The 2016 regulatory definition requires that the interaction between employees with disabilities and individuals without disabilities be dissected down to the \"work unit\" which has the effect of excluding typical community jobs such as custodial, landscaping and food service crews that often pay well above minimum wage. \n\nEasterseals Southeast Wisconsin asks that you modify the current regulatory definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" by restating the statutory definition instead, which I have included below for your reference:\n\nWIOA STATUTORY DEFINITION (P.L. 113-128, Page 1633)\n(5) COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT.The term competitive integrated employment means work that is performed on a full-time or part-time basis (including self-employment)\n(A) for which an individual\n(i) is compensated at a rate that  \n(I)(aa) shall be not less than the higher of the rate specified in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) or the rate specified in the applicable State or local minimum wage law; and\n(bb) is not less than the customary rate paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by other employees who are not individuals with disabilities, and who are similarly situated in similar occupations by the same employer and who have similar training, experience, and skills; or\n(II) in the case of an individual who is selfemployed, yields an income that is comparable to the income received by other individuals who are not individuals with disabilities, and who are self-employed in similar occupations or on similar tasks and who have similar training, experience, and skills; and\n(ii) is eligible for the level of benefits provided to other employees;\n(B) that is at a location where the employee interacts with other persons who are not individuals with disabilities (not including supervisory personnel or individuals who are providing services to such employee) to the same extent that individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with other persons; and\n(C) that, as appropriate, presents opportunities for advancement that are similar to those for other employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who have similar positions.\n\nThank you for your consideration of our request.

The DCL outlines the following: \no   Both parties must be notified in writing regarding the outcome of the complaint and their right to an appeal \no   The complaint is investigated adequately, reliably, and impartially \no   There is a designated and reasonably prompt time frame for major stages of the process\no   Universities must use the preponderance of evidence standard. The preponderance of evidence standard is consistent with the standard of proof established for violations of civil rights laws. \no   Both parties must have an equal opportunity to present relevant witness and other evidence. \no   Both parties must be afforded similar and timely access to any information that will be used in the Title IX hearing\no   If the university permits lawyers in the process, then both parties must have the option to choose a lawyer\no   All university personnel who are involved in the Title IX process, must have training or experience in handling complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. \nThe OCR must continue to investigate universities that do not adhere to these standards so that the integrity of the process is maintained. Currently, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter provides timely, necessary, and effective regulation to support universities in their responsibility to students. There is no reason to rescind the 2011 Dear Colleague letter, or the 2001 Dear Colleague Letter, when both documents provide the necessary foundation for universities to be successful in their responsibilities to students and their families. \n","1011":"Pursuit to Presidential Executive Order (EO) 13777,  Federal agencies are directed to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force (Task Force) to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to agency heads to repeal, replace, or modify relevant regulations.

Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying\nvocational rehabilitation job referrals to employers based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program.\nWIOA is an important piece of legislation that received considerable bipartisan support in Congress. Attaining competitive integrated employment\nis a goal for all individuals with disabilities receiving vocational rehabilitation (VR) services in WIOA. However, it appears the integrated location\ncriterion in the final regulation is based on an overly simplistic and inaccurate understanding of the types of jobs that are provided through the\nAbilityOne Program. As a result, I am concerned that RSA is no longer recognizing employment in the AbilityOne program as a viable employment\nopportunity for people with disabilities because RSA incorrectly views these jobs as \"not typically found in the community\".\nAbilityOne jobs are real jobs. Yet, RSA has said that \"factors that generally would result in a business being considered not typically found in the\ncommunity include\" the funding of positions through Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act contracts.\" With this interpretation which significantly exceeds statutory\nlanguage, with as many as 18 states have already communicated their decision to cease referring people with disabilities to AbilityOne jobs even though\nthey are in an integrated setting and pay wages well above the federal minimum wage.  I am asking you to rescind the guidance and clarify to state\nVR agencies that job opportunities are not to be automatically disqualified simply because of their affiliation with the AbilityOne program.

I am currently a Title IX Coordinator at a small liberal arts private college in upstate NY but I started out in the health\/sex education realm. As someone who is in the trenches, doing this work daily, I do agree that things are not perfect, however, we are making strides. I watched your address and while I agree we have areas for improvement, I disagree that it all needs to be overhauled. Instead of revoking the 2011 guidance, I recommend providing further guidance that seeks to enhance the work that has been done. \n\nI do not believe that Regional Centers will be the answer to ensuring that rights are respected and voices are heard.  Taking cases off of campus and leaving it to government oversight will not improve the already imperfect system. Instead, I believe that focusing on standards for those who are tasked with helping to remedy these cases is of the utmost importance. Ms. DeVos spoke of schools that didn't afford rights to all parties, didn't listen to claims, etc. - much, if not all of this has to do with those that are tasked with making decisions. Create standards for Title IX Coordinators, empower schools to hire and employ competent, trained, and highly educated staff to handle these cases. Provide funding for training of judicial boards and those who are tasked with adjudication of such cases. \n\nSchools struggle with hiring the right kind of people to have oversight of these cases - I STRONGLY believe that schools do not understand what is needed to do good work in this realm. As someone who has done this work, I can confidently say that it is not a lawyer or a legal professional that is needed to ensure that these cases are handled with integrity and tact. I believe that our best work is accomplished by those who are knowledgeable about human behavior and sexuality. It is not a legal issue when someone comes forward about an assault per se, it is a human issue. We need to have individuals who are knowledgeable about why or how people make the choices they do, they need to be compassionate and they need to be able above all else to listen. When all parties have their voices heard, they are less likely to be upset about the outcome. When schools are worried about being sued or worried about lawyers mucking up the process, they lose sight of the real concern... someone on their campus potentially harmed another. \n\nOur campus procedures need to afford rights, provide a thorough investigation and offer remedies to all parties. Our campuses are the perfect place to handle these cases, we just need to do a better job of equipping those who make these decisions with the tools and the power to do it. \n\nI have been fortunate to have a campus administration that values my insight and respects my position on campus. I have a great working relationship with our State Police and have done much work to try to develop important relationships with others in the community as well. We do have a ways to go but we are in a much better place than we were 6 years ago.

I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\nThe student I teach are Black, English Language Learners, and Latino students who need protection against discriminatory policies and practices.  They are female students who need to know they are safe at school. They are LGBTQ students who are not sure they will be protected by adults and who sometimes find adults are the bullies.  Our students with disabilities need to know they are just as valued, capable, important and protected as their peers who do not experience disabilities.  None of the regulations that protect these students should be modified or replaced, only extended and enhanced.  These students are people who matter, who are in our care, and who need protection from discrimination.\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all children.

I share their shock and disbelief that it is somehow a priority to address the wrongfully accused over the survivors of rape. Statistically, of the reported cases of sexual assault, anywhere between 2% and 8% are wrongfully accused. This also is only of the reported cases. Reporting this kind of a crime is extremely difficult and already is under-reported. For Betsy DeVos to have come out making a statement that seemingly equates the victims of this crime to those wrongfully accused not only is mis-informed, it creates a barrier for all the people out there who have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted or harassed to remain silent on what has happened to them. \n\nTitle IX is a pathway towards addressing a very real public health crisis in a more survivor focused way. One in five women will experience sexual assault on a campus they are attending. The onus should be on the campus and on the Department of Education to do everything in their power to change these statistics by applying a way to be honest about how this happens and publicly announce how the person who has experienced sexual assault can and should speak out and that the authorities have their back in bringing justice and changing the environment of rape culture on campus.\n\nIn summary I support what Title IX stands for and I urge you to keep these guidelines in place or to strengthen them. \n\nThank you \n","1066":"Please do not to repeal, replace, or modify current civil rights regulations.

Approximately 75% of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch yet our school site does not get more money for these students than the other school across town with a much smaller percentage of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch.  Additionally, about 18% of our student body are English Language Learners (ELL).  Across town it is half of that.  We receive a greater portion of the Title III budget for them that helps us run and amazing newcomer English Language Development (ELD) program in addition to sheltered or SDAIE class for each graduation class to help these students succeed and graduate from high school.  Now, though, the director of secondary education is pushing to reduce the number of ELD and SDAIE classes, but not because this would improve the education of our ELLs.  She is pushing reduction in ELL and SDAIE classes to have purity in Small Learning Community classes.  We are being told the there are too many singleton classes putting too much pressure on the master schedule to have so many ELD and SDAIE classes.

I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws. As a teacher for 30 years, I have seen the positive changes these laws have brought about for students. \n\nWhen I first started teaching in 1987, English Learners were extremely marginalized. One of my friends who attended school during this time joked that he had became such a good artist because all he did was sit in the back of the room and color. Laws passed to be inclusive of English Learners have resulted in the requirement to make curriculum accessible to ALL students, regardless of the language they speak upon arrival at our schoolhouse door. Thanks to these laws, many districts now have robust Dual Language Immersion programs, where not only do children who come to school speaking a language other than English leave school as fluent bilinguals, students who come to school speaking only English also leave school as fluent bilinguals. This is a resource that is sorely needed in our country. \n\nI have also seen, as a former student, the positive effects of civil rights law in education. A simple example: prior to Title IX passage, the young women on our high school basketball team were using balls labeled \"Boys Practice\" during games: discarded balls from the boys' basketball team. Girls and young women are entitled to equal treatment at school as boys. They are also entitled to be protected from sexual assault. While I do not support a lack of due process for young men who are accused of sexual assault, historically the problem has not been that; it has been that assault is underreported by young women and when it is reported, is often swept under the rug. It has been disturbing to hear talk of going back to a time when women are treated as lesser than and not listened to or believed when they report a sexual assault. As a fellow female, I would think you would understand how critically important it is for young women to minimally feel physically safe while attending school. \n\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality education for all children.

Of Education's website.\n\nInformation from the letters is open to the public and helps parents and school districts across the country clarify federal laws that help to protect students and their parent advocates.  Knowledge is power for everyone.\n\nParents of special needs children have very few avenues in which to help them understand federal laws which can be vague or easily misinterpreted by parents, states and school districts across the country....laws that are intended to protect the rights of children and teens with special needs.\n\nStates need the guidance just as much as parents in order to ensure that they are meeting compliance under the laws.\nIf states and school districts don't understand the federal laws which they are responsible for upholding and have no guidance from their parent organization, the consequences of failure to uphold those laws will cost the public financially in terms of legal liability.  We have seen that when states are left to govern themselves in education, standards and the application of the law varies wildly across the country.  However, putting a one size fits all standard on everyone doesn't work either, especially when special needs students unique needs are ignored.\n\nNot only will this action create more lawsuits which will clog up our court system, many many deserving students who learn differently will be denied their rights to a free appropriate public education leading to poor outcomes, which society will bare the burden of in terms of cost.  \n\nThe supports in our state are horrid.  I don't recognize the state I grew up in anymore and certainly don't trust my state to make sound educational decisions.  I spend a lot of my time doing other people's jobs and putting out educational fires that often come along with raising special needs kids.  There has to be a better way.  Nobody seems to be upholding the laws that are in place.  That's why public education isn't working for special needs kids.  Common core education complicated the process for both educators and parents tremendously.  Our state went broke because of political irresponsibility and my family is paying the price for that both medically and educationally.  Our costs have tripled to quadrupled over the past 8 years. \n\nUnfortunately, our country just doesn't have enough options in the private sector to meet our special needs kids.  Parents and special needs students also loose certain rights by privately placing their children.\n\nI have two children with special needs and have experienced both the public and private education systems and neither were ideal to meet their unique and multiple needs.  \n\nIf special needs kids are to be independent productive members of society, a good education is a must.  And yes, it costs more.  However, the cost of not providing an education to meet their unique needs would be much much more costly to society over a lifetime, when they can't function or function minimally and the public will need to bare the cost burden for their care.\n\nIn order for alternatives to work, there must be a solid plan and better alternatives (in which parent and student rights are intact and protected), if you're going to take away a valuable resource open to the public or provide choices in the private sector.

Personally, I have lost a lot, financially, emotionally and socially.  \n\nDon't put the cart before the horse.

Defining integration as occurring at the \"work unit\" level is job limiting and so subjective that it would be impossible to apply to the general workforce given that people with disabilities have every right to their privacy. It only targets people who work through providers of services to people with disabilities, which is inherently unfair and treats people with disabilities differently from the workforce at large.

","1124":"I work at a nonprofit rape crisis center, and Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault are vital and necessary.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where sexual assault is common, and college sexual assault is frequent.  Survivors we serve have greatly benefited from the provisions of Title IX, and we, as a nation, should be doing everything we can both to prevent violence and mitigate the negative effects in survivors' lives. ","1125":"Please reconsider changing Title IX rights for sexual assault victims. My daughter did not even make it to a college campus before she was raped. She was in 7th grade. The school did not follow the guidelines and she was forced to sit through 4 out of 6 classes with her rapist and continued to be harassed at school because no protections were provided. Ultimately, we removed her from the system. She's a prime example of what happens when no guidelines are in place or enforced. \n\nI'm happy to share my story further, if you like. I am a Republican, a Trump supporter, and an American Government Professor. However, I am also the parent of a child who was raped, and will continue to fight for her rights in the hope that we can protect and change the justice system so that the perpetrators, rather than the victims are penalized for their crimes.\n\nThank you ","1126":"Sexual violence is the most underreported, unconvicted violent crime in America. Title IX provides critical protections for students to continue to pursue their education while overcoming the trauma of sexual abuse. The Dear Colleague letter and other activities taken to promote Title IX under the Obama Administration encouraged schools to take prompt action to increase protections for survivors of sexual violence. \nPER NSVRC: The majority of sexual assaults, an estimated 63 percent, are never reported to the police (Rennison, 2002). The prevalence of false reporting cases of sexual violence is low (Lisak, Gardinier, Nicksa, & Cote, 2010), yet when survivors come forward, many face scrutiny or encounter barriers. For example, when an assault is reported, survivors may feel that their victimization has been redefined and even distorted by those who investigate, process, and categorize cases. Sexual assault victims commonly struggle with a range of emotions that make it difficult for them to report or disclose abuse. Often, victims who do report will delay doing so (Archambault & Lonsway, 2006) for a variety of reasons that are connected to neurobiological and psychological responses to their assault (D'Anniballe, 2010). For example, victims may struggle to remember precise details of the assault or experience negative feelings when doing so (D'Anniballe, 2010). Victims may worry about how reporting will affect their family or friends (Campbell, 1998). Further, they may be fearful of family fracture if the person sexually assaulting them is a family member (Campbell & Raja, 1999).In addition, completing the forensic exam or \"rape kit,\" can be a struggle for victims. For example, answering personal questions, enduring an intensive physical exam and evidence collection prevents some victims from pursuing a criminal justice resolution.To date, much of the research conducted on the prevalence of false allegations of sexual assaults is unreliable because of inconsistencies with definitions and methods employed to evaluate data (Archambault, n.d.). A review of research finds that the prevalence of false reporting is between 2 percent and 10 percent. The following studies support these findings:  \n- A multi-site study of eight U.S. communities including 2,059 cases of sexual assault found a 7.1 percent rate of false reports (Lonsway,Archambault, & Lisak, 2009).\n- A study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston from 1998-2007 found a 5.9 percent rate of false reports (Lisak et al., 2010).\n- Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, researchers studied 812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-2003 and found a 2.1 percent rate of false reports (Heenan & Murray 2006). \nResearch shows that rates of false reporting are frequently inflated, in part because of inconsistent definitions and protocols, or a weak understanding of sexual assault. Misconceptions about false reporting rates have direct, negative consequences and can contribute to why many victims don't report sexual assaults (Lisak et al., 2010). To improve the response to victims\nof sexual violence, law enforcement and service providers need a thorough understanding of sexual violence and consistency in their definitions, policies and procedures.(https:\/\/www.nsvrc.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf)","1127":"Ms. DeVos\n\nDon't attempt to change things for the better.

The current Title IX guidelines are in place to recognize and protect against the real, observable, and documented violence and discrimination on US campuses. The systems of our patriarchal culture, which is often exacerbated on college campus, reinforce this violence and discrimination and make these guidelines necessary. There are NO systems that exist that threaten masculine-presenting students on the basis of gender. Fighting female-targeted gender-based violence is NOT threatening masculine\/male students. It is simply necessary. To change the guidelines to \"protect\" a group of people systematically privileged by society is simply ludicrous. \n\nAs a survivor of sexual assault who is actively involved in prevention and response on my own campus, I understand the ways that this change will affect students in need of its protection.

While this document does offer some valuable advice for protecting possible victims of sexual violence, the insistence of a preponderance of evidence standard for resolving cases and lack of procedures for minimizing burden on those accused may violate the civil rights of innocent people falsely accused of sexual assault. An expulsion or suspension for sexual assault becomes part of a student's record, which at the very least carries a stigma, and at worst, could unfairly prevent a student from furthering his or her education.\n\nPlease consider rescinding this guidance and replacing it with new guidance that allows schools to use a \"clear and convincing\" standard for settling these serious cases, and which guides schools on how to protect the civil rights of both the complainant and the accused.\n\nRespectfully,\nAmanda Love","1172":"I want to urge the Department of Education to maintain all Title IX protections for sexual assault survivors, as outlined in the Dear Colleague letter.

False reporting is rare, because from what I've experienced, it's MUCH worse for victims to speak out. They receive harassment and judgment that forces them to relive one of the worst moments of their life. Every girl that I know personally, who was raped in college, never reported it because they were also afraid of an unsupportive administration. Recent Title IX protections have made moves to remedy that and provide these girls with the help that they need. We need to act boldly for the safety of these girls. \n\nSecretary DeVos's speech last week did more to shame victims into silence than give any hope. Why would you want to roll back any protections in place? Most girls don't know about Title IX protections, which is why we need to increase education on the available protections.

I hate to admit it, but I can see why many people from all over the political spectrum, even many who, in general, disapprove of Betsy DeVos, agree with the recent announcement about Title IX guidelines. \n\nHowever, there are several logical arguments to be made in support of the \"Dear Colleague\" letter and the guidelines it offers, and these are the arguments I will make. The issues that Betsy DeVos raises with the current Title IX guidelines include a \"lack of due process\" and a standard of evidence that is too low. Many also argue that sexual misconduct should be left to the criminal court system.\n\nTwo years ago, I reported a sexual assault on the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities campus, and so I know firsthand how my university handles these cases. For the most part, it followed the Dear Colleague guidelines. Since I have had this experience, I am qualified to make a statement about the current system for reporting sexual misconduct on campus. \n\nThe 5th Amendment to the Constitution includes a due process clause, stating that \"no person shall... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...\" In common understanding, \"due process\" refers to a notification of the charges and a fair trial. Standard of evidence is not a part of due process. In a standard university Title IX case, following the Dear Colleague guidelines, a student is first notified when he or she has been reported for an offense. He or she is given a chance to give their own side of the story, and suggest other witnesses who can support or verify details. At the conclusion of the investigation, if the accused student is found to be more likely than not to be responsible for sexual misconduct, he or she receives a letter from the Title IX office informing them of the charge(s). They are also offered an \"informal resolution\", which includes one or more disciplinary sanction(s) they can agree to. In some cases, this can be as benign as a formal warning. The student can choose to either accept the sanction(s), or submit an appeal, requesting for the case to be re-heard in a formal hearing. In the formal hearing, the student can have an advocate or lawyer present to argue their case. At the University of Minnesota, they can even have the help of a free lawyer from Student Legal Services. If they are still found responsible, they can appeal the ruling yet again to the Provost. \n\nWith the clear notification of charges, the right to have a hearing, and the right to appeal the charges a second time, I see no lack of due process. Aside from that, the constitutional right promises due processes in cases where \"life, liberty, or property\" are on the line. In university, life and liberty are not on the line. The most severe sanction that can be given out is expulsion, and this does not remove student's life or liberty. An argument could be made that after investing money, time, and effort on higher education, a student could be, in a way, losing property from being expelled. However, there are many students who are expelled for violations of student conduct codes, and many more who have to drop out because of lack of money, poor academic success, or health issues, and this is not considered a loss of property. A student expelled from college still gets to keep whatever knowledge he or she gained from the courses he or she took. \n\nThe preponderance of evidence standard, also known as \"more likely than not\" or \"50 percent and a feather\", would not be appropriate in a court of law, where those found guilty for sexual misconduct often must register as sex offenders and\/or receive prison sentences. However, this is not the case in a university proceeding. Again, the \"worst case\" scenario is expulsion. Universities are given great liberty to choose their students, which is why potential students must submit applications. If a university can easily reject a potential student, it is not unreasonable for it to expel a student who is considered more likely than not to have committed sexual misconduct. \n\nIn conclusion, the primary arguments against the current Title IX procedures make the assumption that a university proceeding is equivalent to one in the criminal court system, despite the fact that The potential sanction(s) are much more forgiving than in a criminal court. Although it is a stretch to say that life, liberty, and\/or property are on the line, students are given due process. The university system does not find students guilty of crime, but rather responsible (or, in many cases, not responsible) for a violation of the student conduct code. Therefore, it is just as fair as any other university disciplinary proceeding.

Along with countless others, I was a firsthand witness to the prevalence and under-reporting of campus sexual assault and harassment, both as an undergraduate and as a law student. I have advocated for survivors through work with Legal Aid and have seen the human face of the data collected under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), 20 U.S.C.  1092(f), in 2009: nearly 3,300 reported forcible sex offenses, as defined by the Clery Act, on college campuses. Schools' must maintain the responsibility to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence on campus and to protect victims\/survivors of assault. \n\nSecretary DeVos needs to understand that false accusations are not the paramount problem; the statistics show that prevalence of assault and under-reporting are the paramount problems. Obama-era policies are worth saving, they have protected many students and forced colleges to confront problems that would have otherwise been kept quiet. \"Underreporting by campus sexual assault victims stems from a combination of individual, institutional and socio-cultural factors. While stranger-rape myths have been largely eradicated throughout society, acquaintance rape myths have only recently begun to be challenged\" (Campus Sexual Assault: How America's Institutions of Higher Education Respond; Author(s): Heather M. Karjane ; Bonnie S. Fisher; Francis T. Cullen, October 2002, p. 12). Institutional policies contribute to under-reporting and prevalence of campus sexual assault, and the problem of under-reporting cannot be overstated when fewer than 5 percent of completed and attempted rapes perpetrated on college students are reported to law enforcement (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000; Schwartz & Leggett, 1999). Sexual assault survivors on college campuses need to be protected and supported so that we can fight this culture of silencing and shaming victims. \n\nIf survivors know they will be supported and protected, more of them will come forward after an assault. If perpetrators know they will be held accountable for their actions, more of them will think twice before abusing classmates. Stand with survivors, maintain the critical Title IX (Title 9) protections for survivors of campus sexual assault as guided by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter.","1185":"For nearly 50 years, the civil rights of students, including those with disabilities - from infancy into adulthood - have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U.S. Congress.

I believe this law has matched with part II of the six identifiers as laid out in this document: this law is ineffective. This law has become involved in sexual assault and rape cases on college campuses. As part of this involvement, there has been an consistent inability of college campuses to appropriately deal with those accused of sexual assault on multiple occasions. Male students--who are most often accused of sexual assault--have been subject to harassment, oftentimes endorsed by college faculty members, who--as a person in an institution receiving federal funds--have an obligation to enforce equal treatment regardless of sex (or gender). This treatment has not been dealt out equally to members of different sexes, and has not been corrected or regulated by Title IX alone.\n\nTitle IX must be modified to protect the rights of the students accused of rape or sexual assault on college campuses equally, and provide protection from discriminatory retaliation. To this end I would suggest that TItle IX have an additional stipulation added that college campuses that do not adequately protect the rights of the accused on campus should not receive federal funding, or should be fined appropriately. \n\n","1187":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nMy name is Christopher and I am writing to you today on behalf of my little brother, who a senior in high school in coastal Georgia, and every other student in America subject to terrible cafeteria food.

More children are going hungry because the food that is being served is absolute trash (whole-grain crust \"pizza\" and biscuits, seriously?). The program does not take into consideration high school athletes who need higher calorie counts than most students their age. Student athletes will regularly have a weight training session sometime during school followed by a 2-3 hour practice after school. Some students, depending on the school district and how rural they are, do not get home until later in the evening. Having been fed a \"healthy and nutritious\" lunch, which if you actually look at the meals they are being served, they are repulsive and anything but sustenance. \n\nAs a former football player myself, I had 4,000-5,000+ daily calorie intake, and that was necessary for muscle growth and energy to perform out on the field.

Title IX gave me the support I needed from my school when I felt like it had violated me. It supported me in the fact that it would hold students accountable who violated the student code of conduct. It made campus feel more safe to me after my assault. It made me feel powerful and that I was a student that had worth, I was important to the university, my voice mattered and my experiences mattered.

Unfortunately, she is experiencing the harsh reality of the \"real world\" when it comes to what a hiring manager is wanting from an employee. I know we would all like to think that discrimination doesn't exist for her and others like her but for her right now, this is a very real. She will not be as productive as someone without her limitations and therefore, her \"ability to do the job\" is limited.

Allowing her and other individuals with disabilities to be paid for their productivity, even if it's below the standard wage, affords them to opportunity to share these work experience that you cannot attach a price tag to.

(see below for full text)\n\nTechnological advances are providing post-secondary institutions massive opportunities to offer rigorous online education free from geographic constraint.   The majority of universities and colleges around the country are now offering or will soon be offering online programs.   \n\nNo longer is physically being on a college campus or in a specific geographic region necessary to fully participate in a rich post-secondary experience.  Online options increase the ability of students to have greater access to quality education regardless of life circumstance and provide institutions with larger potential student pools.  \n\nTherefore, the designation of \"regional\" and \"national\" level accreditation is no longer a relevant way to categorize accrediting bodies. Please accept the recommendation that accreditation categorization is simply \"institution level\"  and \"program level\".  \n\nThe current geographic organization of accreditation stewardship is antiquated.  We live in a connected world where geography of physical location is becoming less of a limiting factor.  To allow institutions of higher education to compete in a globally connected world, this change is essential.  Making this change to accreditation designation will foster innovation, domestic and global competitiveness and improve outcomes for students and institutions. \n\nThe following is an example of how the current \"regional\"\/\"national\" system is harming students and thwarting innovation. \n\nThe Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) is presently categorized as \"national\" accreditor.  It is recognized by the US Department of Education as an institution level accreditor.  It is an excellent organization whose standing was just reaffirmed by the USDE.  It has accredited some of the most innovative institutions such as Western Governors University.  A comparison of DEAC's accreditation standards, processes, costs, and timelines of regional accreditors, such as NWCCU and WASC, demonstrates that DEAC accreditation standards are the same and at least as rigorous as regional accreditors.  The process for gaining and retaining accreditation with DEAC is just as difficult, time consuming, and costly as a regional accreditor.   DEAC's individual degree approval is actually more complex and detailed than that of most regional accreditors.  \n\nBecause DEAC is categorized as a \"national accreditor\", students who graduate from DEAC accredited schools are often denied transfer credit or degree recognition at regionally accredited schools.   Additionally, some professional organizations, such as the Illinois CPA organization will not allow someone who has credits from a nationally accredited school to sit for the CPA exam in that state.  There is no justification for this.  It harms students.  It harms schools.  It harms businesses who may be missing out on exceptional talent simply because they chose to attend a \"nationally\" accredited school instead of a \"regionally\" accredited one.  \n\nMany people and organizations simply don't know there is a difference between \"regional\" and \"national\" accreditation.   For example, leaders who set policy in HR departments, may have only ever heard of \"regionally accredited\" schools.  They may inadvertently write into policy that employees must have graduated from a 'regionally accredited school\".  In effect, they assume that \"regional accreditation\" is just a term that represents all forms of higher education accreditation.  They don't realize that by including the statement \"regional\" they are excluding a vast number of potentially exceptional employees.\n\nThere is much more that can be said about this issue.  Making this change may meet with some resistance because, at present, regional accreditors have massive amounts of power over what schools can operate competitively in the US & abroad and they have significant control over allocation of federal education dollars.  Some regional accreditors may perceive this change as threat.  However, this change isn't about diminishing regional accreditors, it is bringing the oversight of higher education current with the technological advances that connect the world, drive industry, and increase prosperity.  It is about reducing barriers to entry and allowing innovation to emerge to serve the needs of students, communities, and industries.\n\nThank you for your time and serious consideration.  \n\nRe:  602.11   Geographic scope of accrediting activities\n\nThe agency must demonstrate that its accrediting activities cover\n\n(a) A State, if the agency is part of a State government;\n\n(b) A region of the United States that includes at least three States that are reasonably close to one another; or\n\n(c) The United States.\n\n","1202":"Please don't roll back hard won rights and opportunities for young people with disabilities.

The families we represent rely daily on these important implementation tools in their advocacy for their children's educational rights. \n\nThe regulations listed for possible repeal, replacement or modification in the U.S. Department of Education (ED) have already gone through the open, transparent, and prescribed procedure as mandated by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). For all regulations, the rulemaking process begins after Congress passes a bill and the President signs it into law. Before the draft rule is published by the federal agency, it is reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The public then has 30 to 90 days to provide feedback. Agencies must consider all comments, document responses to them, and develop a revised regulation that is then sent to OMB for final review. In some cases, these regulations undergo a second comment period before final regulations are published. This process allows for meaningful stakeholder input on the specific rules to which changes are proposed, as compared to ED's current process in which any and all regulations and guidance documents are at risk making meaningful input impossible.\n\nFor the reasons described above, we urge ED not to repeal, replace, or modify any regulations or guidance under the laws we have listed. \n\nWe are not commenting on any specific regulations or guidance documents because the regulations and guidance under review are so extensive that we cannot possibly defend all those that are critically important in a single document. We will, however, note our grave concern that some organizations are taking aim at regulations under IDEA, the negotiated assessment regulations under ESSA, and the definition of competitive integrated employment under WIOA.

Although a diagnosis does not determine individual need, understanding the underlying cause of disability provides crucial information for programming.\n \n* Rules requiring that IEPs must be developed by by trained and knowledgeable personnel (CFR 300.304) with expertise in the specific areas of disability.   Lack of specially trained staff for determining the comprehensive needs of each student results in a lack of educational growth and progress for students with disabilities.  Comprehensive evaluations should be required to review student progress in all areas related to the suspected disability.\n \n* Students who are blind must be evaluated and provided specialized instruction by teachers with certification in visual impairment and certified orientation and mobility specialists; students who have hearing impairment must be evaluated and provided specialized instruction by certified teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing with the related services provided by knowledgeable and trained audiologists and staff trained and competent in their communication modes.  For students with DeafBlindness, the lowest incidence among this group, an appropriate IEP requires a knowledgeable and trained specialist: teacher of the DeafBlind to help guide the educational team.\n \n* Maintain rules that require determination of the student's learning and literacy medium, including the use of braille, low vision devices, etc.\n \n*The earliest possible implementation of effective intervention has long been strongly supported by research.  Regulations requiring states and local agencies to have active child find and early intervention activities must be maintained and strengthened. \n \n* Rules should continue to require Individual Education Plans that include the provisions in 34 CFR 300.320 through 300.324, that outline the components of the IEP.  In particular, the inclusion of academic AND FUNCTIONAL skills in IDEA is important.  Students with visual impairments, including DeafBlindness, must have evaluation and specialized instruction in blindness specific areas, including mobility, alternative communication modes such as braille, assistive technology, and unique adaptations to master social skill and self-determination, independent living skills, vocational skills, and to graduate prepared for meaningful and productive adult lives.\n \n* Keep and strengthen the requirement for a continuum of alternative placements, or a range of placement options to meet the needs of students with disabilities for special education and related services.

Parents struggle to have intervener services considered because of the lack of awareness and understanding of deafblindness. Intervener services have been recognized by OSEP as a credible service delivery option for children who are DeafBlind under the IEP process.

Campus disciplinary proceedings should use a standard of evidence no higher than a preponderance of the evidence. \n\nThank you for listening.  ","1286":"90% of students who are sexually assaulted on a college campus do not report to a criminal justice system. \n\nThis is because the criminal justice system has historically skewed unfairly against survivors of sexual assault in proving their violation, ignoring the psychological effect that the trauma of sexual violence has on the brain that affects memory and immediate decision making; the continued trauma of a survivor being vilified for their sexual history, sexual orientation, and physical presentation regardless of whether it is relevant to their acute victimization; increased amount of time and money that affect whether someone is able to go through the entire criminal process and can lead to recanting of legitimate claims; and the historical and institutional bias against survivors of color, immigrant or undocumented status, disability, and LGBTQ+ identity. \n\nPrioritizing the needs of those who have, more likely than not (2-8% of claims are likely to be unsubstantiated, a figure that includes those cases where a minor \"consents\" to having sex with an adult, where other non-sexual violence\/abuse was present, and where a survivor with evidence supporting their claim recants due to intimidation tactics or fear) committed violence over those who have been victimized is a horrific way to evaluate and regulate public policy. \n\nThe suggestion that the public institution would benefit from a criminal justice model also ignores the difference in consequences between a criminal outcome and a university outcome (those found guilty of violating a school's sexual violence policy are not automatically required to register as sex offenders, for example). \n\nFurthermore, narrowing the types of sexual violence that \"count\" under the interpretation of Title IX policies removes opportunities for healing trauma faced by survivors of sexual harassment and abuse, most specifically male students whose abuse is largely considered in the social sphere to be less severe or even impossible. Therefore, narrowing this definition will only increase the amount of trauma, pain, and distrust that college survivors experience, creating deficits in collective health and educational success as well as supporting a culture of violence against more vulnerable populations. \n\nChanging the process on college campuses to reflect a criminal process solely to benefit the accused is incredibly dangerous and misguided, and shows a clear lack of understanding of both the survivor experience and public institutions.

These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious, job-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation.  \nMany programs create jobs and locates opportunities for people with disabilities. Because placement criteria has become so stringent finding employment opportunities in small rural committees is difficult.  Deserving individuals with significant disabilities are denied employment opportunities since support is limited due to imposed requirements. This negatively impacts the person's ability to gain and maintain employment.   \nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEd's website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne Program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation.\n","1290":"Students with disabilities deserve all the help they can get.\nDon't mess with this legislation.","1291":"To Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos:\n\nFederal regulations and non-regulatory guidance help states fully implement laws such as the WIOA, which is critical to ensuring that individuals with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other individual. Stakeholders rely on these authorities to assist them in understanding and complying with the statutes. As such, none should be modified or rescinded by the Administration. \n\nMy 23-year-old son's  intellectual disability limits his employment options; Pennsylvania's program under WIOA could help him find competitive employment, which would offer the opportunity for himand other adults with intellectual disabilities to support himself instead of relying on state and federal aid like ID waivers and SSI for support.\n\nI urge you to keep current provisions\/regulations of the WIOA in place without modifications to help adults with intellectual disabilities achieve independence.","1292":"As an educational administrator I have seen the positive impact that Title IX, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, and improved institutional response have had on college campuses in addressing and preventing sexual misconduct. I work intimately with these cases and with all Involved Parties when a complaint is received. The DOE, Federal Government, and current administration must maintain this guidance not only to continue supporting addressing of these vital situations but also because it is the right thing to do in ensuring that our college students can pursue their education from fear of sexual misconduct interfering with their education and pursuits after a collegiate education.","1293":"I believe the 2011 and 2001 Dear Colleague Letters have proven to be timely, necessary, and effective in addressing sexual discrimination on college and university campuses.  The OCR must continue to investigate universities that do not adhere to these standards so that the integrity of the process is maintained. Currently, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter provides timely, necessary, and effective regulation to support universities in their responsibility to students. There is no reason to rescind the 2011 Dear Colleague letter, or the 2001 Dear Colleague Letter, when both documents provide the necessary foundation for universities to be successful in their responsibilities to students and their families.  \n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter affirms the 2001 Dear Colleague Letter, namely, reiterating the government's position that universities are charged with the responsibility to take immediate and effective steps to timely respond to sexual violence and sexual discrimination. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter affirms that: \n\no   Every school must have and distribute a policy against sexual discrimination\no   Every school must have a Title IX coordinator whose responsibilities are oversee individual complaints of sexual discrimination and act to address any patterns or systemic problems of sexual violence and sexual discrimination \no   Every school must have and make known a procedure for students to file complaints of sexual discrimination \n\nThe 2011 Dear Colleague Letter also affirms the rights of both the complainant and the respond during the university Title IX process. The DCL recognizes that for the Title IX process to be legitimate, it's essential that both students engage with a process that is fair and equitable. The DCL outlines the following: \n\no   Both parties must be notified in writing regarding the outcome of the complaint and their right to an appeal \no   The complaint is investigated adequately, reliably, and impartially \no   There is a designated and reasonably prompt time frame for major stages of the process\no   Universities must use the preponderance of evidence standard. The preponderance of evidence standard is consistent with the standard of proof established for violations of civil rights laws. \no   Both parties must have an equal opportunity to present relevant witness and other evidence. \no   Both parties must be afforded similar and timely access to any information that will be used in the Title IX hearing\no   If the university permits lawyers in the process, then both parties must have the option to choose a lawyer\no   All university personnel who are involved in the Title IX process, must have training or experience in handling complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. \n\n","1294":"Higher education officials need to be an integral part of any conversation about Title IX on campus.  Title IX coordinators, even more so than general counsels, are on the forefront of these issues within their respective communities.  They have invaluable insight into what is working and what is not working.  Only talking to survivors and due process advocates does not provide a full picture of how we can do better addressing sexual assault on campuses.  Leaving this important group out of the conversation is incredibly short sighted.  Title IX coordinators will be the ones implementing any changes, so they should be a huge part of the conversation.","1295":"I am the parent of 2 special needs young adults.

A child has no choice in the matter of whether he or she is born with special needs. Nor does a child willfully make decisions that cause disabilities. Most people, if they give even a moment's thought on the subject, can identify some child who has overcome tremendous odds to become a productive and inspirational member of society. Should we have thrown Helen Keller away? Was Stevie Wonder expendable? \nIt is unconscionable that the Department of Education would remove educational opportunities for our most vulnerable children. Shame on anyone who is intent on doing so. ","1298":"It's vital that you keep the rules and regulations in place for (IDEA, WIOA and ESSA) special needs students.

I say, \"Thank you, Betsy, but no thanks.\" ","1300":"Secretary DeVos's announcement about backing away from the 2011 DCL is misguided. In her announcement, she acknowledged reviewing the issue she neglected to highlight the purpose of Title IX in responding to sexual harassment and assault in K-higher education environments. Notably, she conflated a person's rights in the criminal justice system with those of a civil process. Title IX is civil rights law and there is danger in crossing that line when responding to a civil complaint. The 2011 DCL provided clear guidelines for schools to develop a system that provides for a fair process for all parties involved. There will be times when victims or accused students believe that the process was not fair and, for this reason, they have a right to file a complaint with OCR or pursue civil litigation. Removing the current guidance is not going to change anything. Schools have dedicated time and resources to developing systems to protect all parties involved. The goal should be to ensure that all students are treated equally (procedural rights) and provided with safe places to learn. The speech from Secretary DeVos was not balanced and focused primarily on the voices of \"falsely accused\" or \"wrongly accused\" students. This dangerous rhetoric presents a non-balanced approach at the highest level and will likely drive victims back into the shadows with a fear of reporting.

I cannot emphasize enough how much the Title IX office helped me not only seek justice but also support me through this challenging time so that I did not drop out of my graduate program. When people experience trauma, the normal cognitive functions devolve--instead of being able to plan and think through various issues, brains experiencing trauma are only able to complete basic functions. This happened to me. After my assault, I became withdrawn, depressed, and suicidal. I stopped seeing my friends and I was unable to go to work. I am a graduate student in a master's level social work program so I am not only academically well-versed in trauma but also have experience working with survivors of trauma. I know what one should do in order to heal from trauma. However, there is a difference between our thinking brains and our emotional brains. So after I was assaulted, I knew what I needed to do in order to heal, but my emotional brain took over and I found myself at rock bottom. Without the help of a sexual assault advocate or the Title IX office, I would not be where I am today--healthier, finishing my graduate program, and feeling like myself again. \n\nThis is why I am writing you.

These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious, job-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSA's guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the department's longstanding practice and technical guidance.

More often than not, useful information is not received from foreign countries hosting our students on a temporary basis.\n\nIACLEA recommends that this reporting requirement be removed.\n\n(2) In sub-regulatory guidance, the Department of Education has directed colleges and universities to collect and report crime statistics for facilities not directly associated with the campus.

This requirement is difficult to comply with and does not enhance the safety of the core campus.\n\nIACLEA recommends that this reporting requirement be removed.\n\n(3) Some of the Clery Act implementing regulations require the reporting of crimes that are not crimes in every state.

It takes additional time to get people in the transition age group (18-24) through the process in order to get to sub-minimum wage positions.  Some families and people with disabilities don't want a community job and are happy at subminimum wage and feel it wastes their time to go through this process and have interviews each year to see if they want to try a community job.  If there was a way to waive this (at person's or guardian's discretion and not the providers), then I think it would be more helpful.  We are also finding that Voc Rehab does not have enough staff to do this and people are waiting a long time for access.  If this is going to continue, additional funding needs to be put in for staffing to ensure timely access.

It makes sense for you to identify your experience to what you are exposed to.  I too, want to protect my children and the world from experiencing sexual assault.  \nYou say that the system established by the previous administration has failed too many students.  Actually, the schools have been the challenge and society's response to sexual assault it what has failed these students.  For years sexual assault has been occurring on campuses, with no response from the school's administration.  Whether it was to maintain their image, the air of safety for incoming students or the funding from sports and Greek organizations, these are the reasons continuously cited for not reporting sexual assault on campuses.  Understand, there has not been an easy answer in our society either.  Women and men who have been assaulted in our communities still have to fight to be heard, believed and experience justice.  Working for a sexual assault advocacy agency, our staff are continuously educating our community.  We see victim blaming as well as fear of what happens to the offender as reasons for acquittal from our jurors.  \n\nIn regard to your comment that the government has overreached in the Title IX interpretation, I disagree with you.  Our colleges receive Federal funding and should create a safe environment for the students as well as hold youth accountable for their actions if they have violated codes of conduct.  Rather than remove the accountability that has taken years to impose upon the Higher Education Institutions, develop protocols to better the systems.  I know of a school that is working to develop fair protocol.  The Title IX Coordinator is a lawyer (many that I have met at conferences are attorneys).  She works to maintain neutrality with all parties.  Though sometimes I disagree with the outcome- few students who report sexual assault on campus actually report to the local police and their requests for the perpetrators range from living off campus and out of their classes to completing therapy so they do not commit sexual assault on another person again- she does complete the judicial review or investigation through due process.  I have watched as this local system has developed and it is improving.  \n\nDuring your interviews- how many students came forward reporting that it was a successful process?  Did you interview any?  All I hear are the complaints.  I would like you to also meet with those who experienced support from the Title IX requirements and find out what worked.  There will always be complaints and problems from new system implementation.  Title IX serves a purpose- to make institutions of higher learning accountable to keep their students safe.  Not write off when women and men are sexually assaulted on campus and asking for help.  Understanding that, they also have a responsibility in providing prevention education because prevention can stop assault before it happens.  If students are living on campus, educating them is key to decreasing and stopping sexual assault.

I have seen the emotional and physical struggle these students endure so they can regain normalcy in their lives and maybe even some form of justice for the wrongs that were forced upon them. Our judicial system does it's best to bring perpetrators to justice, but that is not always the solution for survivors. In some cases, survivors would like to move on with their lives and continue to try and better themselves free of the reminder that the perpetrator is walking campus without any consequences for their actions. The criminal court system can be re-traumatizing for survivors due to the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" requirement for sentencing and the length and duration of criminal hearings.  Survivor's should have options when it comes to healing from sexual assault and harassment. These options should always include filing a criminal charge, filing a Title IX complaint and\/or going through the civil court to file for a protection order as well as resources, advocates and accommodations to make the life altering event easier to heal from.  I believe Title IX provides an additional layer of protection for survivors that does not require a criminal prosecution for them to feel safe while receiving an education.\n\nWhile Title IX guidance on the procedures of investigating a case of sexual harassment seem vague in the Title IX handbook, I believe the 2011 Dear Colleague letter presented procedure very clearly while also giving practical examples. It is true that \"preponderance of evidence\" is the burden of proof in a Title IX investigation. I believe this necessary for the sheer fact that if any individual can't learn and grow without the fear of harassment and\/or persecution, then the smallest amount of evidence backing this up needs to be looked in to and a solution must be found to remedy the situation. More clarity on the issue of how hearings must be handled while maintaining both parties' rights is of great importance, but one incident of a rouge investigation should not be the standard to get rid of Title II, Title VI and Title IX protections to students. \n\nEvery student deserves equal protection under the law to have an education free from discrimination regardless of sex, race, color, national origin, disability status, English proficiency, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Before the existing regulations, survivors at my university were afraid to come forward and seek help or justice; many dropped out of college and even moved out of state because of their trauma and hopelessness. Accused perpetrators were given the benefit of the doubt by officials because of our collective tendency to wish that sexual assault does not happen. In fact, one in five university-age women will be raped; only 2-10% of rape reports are false (the same statistics on false reporting as that for other crimes); few perpetrators end up being convicted in a court of law. Please read Alice Sebold's Lucky for a first-hand account of how difficult it is to obtain a conviction for even violent rape by a stranger. After the new regulations were implemented and our university took sexual assault seriously rather than cloaking reality behind a happy image, students felt much freer to seek help, get treatment, and to try to prevent other students from going through what they went through. Please do not go backwards to the days of students carrying their secret trauma inside and dropping out of school. \n\nTips for comments asks that we cite scientific evidence: I would request that the secretary do the same.

Colleges and universities must be able to continue to oversee their community standards and policies in order to support educational access and fully realize privileges of community members.\n\n-Campus disciplinary proceedings should use a standard of evidence no higher than preponderance of the evidence. This is because the sanctions or consequences of a \"found responsible\" finding in a Title IX investigation are very different than the consequences of being \"found guilty\" in a criminal proceeding. At worst, a student is removed from campus when found responsible.

The Dear Colleague letter has already stated that both complainants and alleged perpetrators have a right to notification of accusations, a right to timely access to all submitted evidence, and a right to tell their side of the story in a Student Conduct hearing (this is, in fact, due process). The evidentiary standard of a preponderance of evidence is appropriate, as it mirrors the civil standards for court proceedings such as Civil Protection Orders. A criminal standard of evidence would NOT be appropriate, as a Student Conduct Hearing is NOT a criminal trial. The purpose of a Student Conduct Hearing is to determine whether the alleged perpetrator has violated the Student Code of Conduct at an educational institution, a contract that they WILLINGLY signed upon admission to a university or college.  If they violate the Student Code of Conduct, it is not a criminal matter unless the victim chooses to report to law enforcement.\n\nThere are already so many barriers in place to prevent victims of sexual violence from coming forward.

And I work with survivors of interpersonal violence. I find the current state of affairs regarding sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking to be quite concerning. \n\nWhile I do not believe that Title IX and the guidance offered are perfect. The Department of Education's Title IX sexual assault guidance and the Clery Act with Campus SaVE amendments are critically important tools for addressing campus sexual harassment and assault. I believe that Title IX and the Clery Act are effective tools to support survivors, increase institutional transparency, hold individual offenders accountable and improve community safety. I am deeply concerned about some of the statements made by Director DeVos in her recent address. \n\nHere are a few of my greatest and deepest concerns. \n\n- 1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually assaulted while in college. Yet, fewer than 10% of sexual assault victims on college campuses report the assault. Any changes in current protections that would make it more difficult for survivors to report or to be believed will have a chilling impact on already low reporting rates. \n\n-   All institutions of higher education need to maintain campus processes with standards befitting a non-criminal, internal proceeding to respond to sexual misconduct. Campus disciplinary proceedings should use a standard of evidence no higher than preponderance of the evidence. Reliance of trial lawyers for input on these cases is faulty on the part of your office. University conduct proceedings are not criminal offenses and so taking guidance from groups rooted in our criminal justice system. I could write an entire dissertation about how our criminal justice system is flawed and entirely focused on the rights of the respondents over justice for victims. This is not the group you should be talking to. Consult Title IX investigators, campus attorney's, victim advocates- these are your experts. \n\n- Trauma- informed processes are key to procedural equity. Equity neither requires nor implies identical treatment, and indeed the Department of Education has long required interim, non-punitive measures to remedy the effects of sexual harassment, of which gender-based violence is an established component. Institutions and student affairs professionals can and should respond to the acute wellness and educational civil rights needs of survivors, needs which exist separately from and not mutually exclusive to the questions of accountability and procedural due process.As professionals, we consistently see the stress of students involved as respondents in conduct processes equated to and conflated with the trauma of students who have experienced gender-based violence. Certainly, regardless of whether an individual student is found responsible for a conduct violation, it is appropriate to offer respondents in gender-based violence cases psychological counseling resources, and stress or crisis management tools via the institution's existing structures or via referrals to off-campus resources. However, respondents have not experienced a trauma (that is, exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence) in the context of the specific behavior at issue in the disciplinary case. Creating a false equivalency between these two experiences prevents us from providing appropriate services to both students. \n\n- Accountability is necessary for repair and prevention is necessary for wellness.One of the most disturbing parts of Secretary DeVos' and her staff's comments on Title IX to date has been perpetuating the myth that no college student really has any inappropriate or abusive sexual behaviors: they are all either victims of false accusations by scorned former partners or unwitting victims of the campus administrators.There are pressing and important questions at hand: about how to ensure that our campus-based conduct processes do not replicate the racial and economic injustices so entrenched in the criminal system; about how to apply sanctions to cases that advance the goal that our students may live safely, without fear of further harm and without harming anyone further. Prevention professionals have at their fingertips solid evidence-informed strategies for educating students in this realm. It is our responsibility as student affairs and allied professionals to address the full range of risk factors in order to enable our students to live safely and thrive, not just on our campuses but in their family systems and post-education lives.  \n\nI remain vehemently concerned that the issue of interpersonal violence has become a politicized patrician topic. Victims of violence are real and not some pawn in an ever depressing game of one-up-manship that has become our national political narrative. \n\n","1598":"I urge the Department of Education not to eliminate rules that prevent dicrimination of the students based on sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability.

After the most severe incidence of harassment, I wandered around campus, alternately numb and crying, wondering what to do. I walked into the library, seeking refuge, and saw my professor- I turned around, my heart beating out of my chest. I felt trapped. I confided in my advisor, another professor, who encouraged me to go to the Dean of Students office to report the incident. I left a message with the secretary, who said that the Dean was not on campus, and I would have to wait until Thursday, two days later. Then, at 7 pm,another email came, from the Director of Student Life, who took time away from her family to come back to campus and meet with me. She listened to me without judgement, and made sure that the Dean and Title IX Coordinator would meet with me the next morning. She assured me that the incident would be taken seriously. \n\nAnd, it was. It turns out that I was not the only student this professor had crossed the line with. Without structures in place that Title IX mandated, I would not have had a safe place to report to, to receive support from. I probably would not have graduated Summa Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa only two years later.\n\nAs an RA on my college campus, I was also embattled with issues relating to sexual violence during my job. Countless students disclosed that they had been raped or sexually assaulted to me; some while on campus, others prior to arriving at college. Regardless of when the assault took place, Title IX allowed myself, and others on campus, to support and protect survivors through access to counseling, no contact orders, and even a formal complaint process. I helped survivors navigate the system- I tried to make them feel safe, feel heard, empowered, like I had been. Without Title IX, I would not have been able to help as many students in crisis as I was able to. Some said that without the support they received, they would have dropped out, or worse. \n\nTitle IX is much more than just a law. It is what ensures students due process and support during one of the most challenging times of our lives. It protects us from our abusers. It empowers us. \n\nI ask you to imagine that, as a young college student of only 19, you were sexually assaulted. What supports would you want in place for yourself? How would you want to be treated? With dignity, respect, and belief, or with blame, shame, and disbelief? \n\nI am asking that the Department of Education not roll back vital Title IX protections that relate to campus sexual assault. \n\n","1611":"Federal regulations and non-regulatory guidance help states and school districts fully implement the laws, such as the IDEA, ESSA, and WIOA, which are critical to ensuring students with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other kid.

Beyond that, do you comprehend how exceedingly difficult it is for women to have their voices heard and to have their truth be believed? It is like pushing a boulder up a mountain - a boulder that weighs 20 times more than you do. This is by no means an exaggeration.\n\nAnd because this is the world women live in, pushback, neglect, double-standards, excuses, and cowardly silence becomes the norm. It becomes the norm for the University establishment to continually sweep the truth of women's experience under the proverbial 'rug'. \n\nI beg you not to make any changes that will adversely impact women's voices being heard and believed. I beg you not to make it still harder for truth and justice to prevail. Because of the current 'norms' surrounding these issues, most women still do not come forward. In fact very few of them do. It is too hard a battle to fight. The odds against achieving a just result are so enormous, it takes a super-strong, resilient, fearless woman to come forward. \n\nUnderstanding this is critical to all people in power, such as yourself. Please, Madam Secretary, educate yourself about the real-life situation on campus as well as the world we live in. \n\nJennifer Townsend\nSeattle, WA","1616":"As a citizen I firmly stand behind the laws listed below and their federal implementing regulations and non-regulatory guidance, which are essential to ensuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families.

Yet, fewer than 10% of sexual assault victims on college campuses report the assault.

Title IX protections are crucial to survivor and campus safety. Most shameful of all is DeVos' claim that the current rules implemented by President Obama are not working, so we should therefore replace them with....nothing, or at least, something she hasn't bothered to share with us yet.\nIt seems that the few, rare cases of false accusation (less than 10% of all claims) are giving DeVos cover to remove protections for women who are assaulted at school. The schools and perpetrators already have more cover than they deserve. DeVos, in typical Republican fashion, highlighted the rare cases of false accusations over the multitude of cases where there is a true cause for action, and reports suggest that so-called mens rights activists had at least as much of DeVos' ear as assault victims. \nThe Dear Colleague letter has comprehensive guidelines that are a great start on advancing the protections for sexual assault victims.\nAs KnowYourIX has noted: Today, Secretary DeVos sent the message to student and survivors across the country that the Department of Education doesn't have their back. Before the Education Department took action to protect survivors, and hold schools accountable, too many young people were forced to drop classes they shared with their rapists, take long leaves of absence, or even leave school entirely. The Department's guidance, which outlined survivors' rights under longstanding federal law, was a response to this urgent reality. Today's announcement risks taking us back to to the days when sexual violence routinely compromised survivors' access to education and schools swept sexual assault under the rug.\nEven if the law is not changing (for now), the regulatory actions to back up this law must stay in place and it is more important to devote energy to helping people understand the Title IX process.","1655":"The definition for \"stalking\" as defined in VAWA as it amends the Clery act isn't a good operational definition.

Employment of individuals with disabilities is a national priority for Easterseals, who last year provided employment services to more than 70,000 jobseekers from across the country.\n\nWe were pleased that the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) included Easterseals-supported provisions to help increase competitive integrated employment opportunities for students and adults with disabilities. WIOA Section 404 defined competitive integrated employment by establishing practical and measurable criteria related to earnings and location. For example, WIOA required that competitive integrated employment be compensated at no less than the minimum wage and  be performed at locations where the employee with disabilities interacts with individuals without disabilities \"to the same extent that individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with other persons.\"\n\nHowever, the Department's 2016 WIOA regulation went well beyond the congressionally agreed-upon statutory definition of competitive integrated employment by prescribing additional regulatory sub-requirements. The 2016 regulatory definition requires that the interaction between employees with disabilities and individuals without disabilities be dissected down to the \"work unit\" which has the effect of excluding typical community jobs such as custodial, landscaping and food service crews that often pay well above minimum wage. \nEasterseals Western and Central Pennsylvania asks that you modify the current regulatory definition of \"competitive integrated employment\" by restating the statutory definition instead, which I have included below for your reference:\n\nWIOA STATUTORY DEFINITION (P.L. 113-128, Page 1633)\n(5) COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT.The term competitive integrated employment means work that is performed on a full-time or part-time basis (including self-employment)\n(A) for which an individual\n(i) is compensated at a rate that  \n(I)(aa) shall be not less than the higher of the rate specified in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) or the rate specified in the applicable State or local minimum wage law; and\n(bb) is not less than the customary rate paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by other employees who are not individuals with disabilities, and who are similarly situated in similar occupations by the same employer and who have similar training, experience, and skills; or\n(II) in the case of an individual who is selfemployed, yields an income that is comparable to the income received by other individuals who are not individuals with disabilities, and who are self-employed in similar occupations or on similar tasks and who have similar training, experience, and skills; and\n(ii) is eligible for the level of benefits provided to other employees;\n(B) that is at a location where the employee interacts with other persons who are not individuals with disabilities (not including supervisory personnel or individuals who are providing services to such employee) to the same extent that individuals who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions interact with other persons; and\n(C) that, as appropriate, presents opportunities for advancement that are similar to those for other employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who have similar positions.\n\nThank you for your consideration of our request.

I believe in fairness and due process. Without due process and dignity for both reporting parties and responding parties, I learned it always came back to hurt victim\/survivors. I also believe in making careful policy decisions based on evidence and data and on practices that protect students and require institutions to practice the highest standard of ethics. According to current Title IX regulations, universities are required to have equitable due process rights and write out what those due process rights look like. I have found that often people who are accused will cite due process violations to circumvent accountability both in university processes and criminal justice processes, but often do not specifically define which due process rights were violated. They often use 'due process' as a buzzword to cast doubt and suspicion on the easily fooled rather than have legitimate arguments around which actual procedural errors occurred by the university. However, should a university actually violate a student's due process rights or violate their own procedures, that's where the Office for Civil Rights comes in to provide accountability to the school. One of the positive things that has happened in the past few years is that higher education has been forced to fix or improve some of it's poor practices and policies regarding how it handles Title IX violations. Before Title IX mandates, these cases were often swept under the rug or mismanaged - and that always favored those who perpetrate rape and violence. To rollback regulations now would also mean a big win for those who rape, signaling they are more important than victims. Another positive is that many university investigators have received far more training on how to investigate these cases effectively than even law enforcement and prosecutors, using evidence-based, researched practices. I have seen first-hand how University Title IX investigations have been conducted more efficiently, thoroughly, and carefully than law enforcement investigations (look up Abby case in MN) where the University investigation led to law enforcement reopening her case and resulted in a conviction and 6 year prison sentence. Danraped Abby and several other women violently and law enforcement and county prosecutors failed them when the first reported the crime. Because of the university investigation, police and prosecutors were able to fix their mistake and seek justice for the several students impacted. It's important to understand that the worst outcome of Title IX investigations result in a student unable to attend the university. That's the same as if they are caught cheating. In most cases, those found responsible and removed from school attend school somewhere else. It does not prevent them from getting an education. So the standard of proof, in alignment with civil law practices, should not be greater than 'preponderance of evidence'. When we examine the outcome of university consequences versus criminal consequences- civil liberties are not taken away like in the criminal justice process. I urge the Secretary and Department to maintain Title IX's current guidelines. Title IX is essential to protecting students from discrimination in recruitment, admissions, counseling, financial assistance, athletics, sex-based harassment, treatment of pregnant and parenting students, discipline, single-sex education, and employment. I especially urge the Department to protect those guidelines included the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) relating to sexual assault and violence on college campuses. Title IX and the DCL guidelines are essential to keeping our college students safe and ending sexual assault on our campuses. I appreciate the Department of Education's past dedication to protecting the rights and safety of students, and allowing the public to be part of this evaluation process. Rolling back Title IX regulations does not show that the Department of Education cares about the safety of the vulnerable.

Then she is subject to the police investigation, which tries to find some negligence or criminality about her, so they can drop the whole issue.  Subsequently she is subject to the defense attorney's right to bring up every vaguely sexual episode in her life, going all the way back to kindergarten, so he or she can claim the woman is unworthy of justice.  The courts will not keep the case under seal, as they would if it involved money or a corporation's reputation.  So the press can relay every salacious detail to audiences which probably include the woman's family and friends.  Finally the woman is subject to the prejudices of the court and the jurors, many of whom were raised on the interpretation of the Adam and Eve story which says that Eve was the sinner, and Adam her innocent victim.  Thus all the daughters of Eve (that is, all women) have inherited her sinful nature, and will trap or seduce men into wrong-doing.  \n\nWhile some women are crazy or severely neurotic, and some accusations are false, this is a very small percentage of actual assaults, verbal or physical.

Although a diagnosis does not determine individual need, understanding the underlying cause of disability provides crucial information for programming. \n\n* Rules requiring that IEPs must be developed by by trained and knowledgeable personnel (CFR 300.304) with expertise in the specific areas of disability.   Especially for students with low incidence disabilities, lack of specially trained staff for determining the comprehensive needs of each student results in lack of FAPE.  Comprehensive evaluations should be required to review student progress in all areas related to the suspected disability.\n\n* Students who are blind  must be evaluated and provided specialized instruction by teachers with certification in visual impairment and certified orientation and mobility specialists; students who have hearing impairment must be evaluated and provided specialized instruction by certified teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing with the related services provided by knowledgeable and trained audiologists and staff trained and competent in their communication modes.  For students with DeafBlindness, the lowest incidence among this group, an appropriate IEP requires a knowledgeable and trained specialist teacher of the DeafBlind to help guide the educational team.\n\n* Keep the rules that require determination of the student's learning and literacy medium, including the use of braille, low vision devices, etc. \n\n*The earliest possible implementation of effective intervention has long been strongly supported by research.  Regulations requiring states and local agencies to have active child find and early intervention activities must be maintained and strengthened.  \n\n* Rules should continue to require IEPS that include the provisions in 34 CFR 300.320 through 300.324, that outline the components of the IEP.  In particular, the inclusion of academic AND FUNCTIONAL skills in IDEA is important.  Students with visual impairments must have evaluation and specialized instruction in blindness specific areas, including mobility, alternative communication modes such as braille, assistive technology, and unique adaptations to master social skill and self-determination, independent living skills, vocational skills, and to graduate prepared for meaningful and productive adult lives. \n\n* Keep and strengthen the requirement for a continuum of alternative placements, or a range of placement options to meet the needs of students with disabilities for special education and related services.

This leads me to my next statement, by the number of public comments this further supports the notion that people aren't concerned about deafblind children or young adults. The truth of the matter s because it's such a low incidence disability that occurs in  to 1% of the school population. It's not being recognized by our Departments of Education across the country.\nOur National Special Education Director in the past did not  recognize the practice of the intervener. This crucially impacted my child from receiving FAPE. So much money is spent on conferences not reaching our children and a lot of this has to do with U.S Department of Special Education's priorities. Where is the true leadership and evidence-based practices? I was personally involved in the pilot program with the \"DEAF BLIND PROJECT\" in VA. Dr. Linda Alsop was a great teacher focusing on issues such as the plasticity of the brain and most importantly the use of the intervener.\nI'm not sure how people are promoted to VA Department of Special Education.\nDirector of the Deaf-Blind Project Mr. John Eisenberg kicked my family and my son's outside of school intervener out of the training. During lunch on my personal time. I didn't understand it at the time but years later I do. For one thing, his intervener at the time was Deaf. A lot of times when you are not in the know you learn everything is a big faade. They don't want others to see my personal success. In spite of them not helping Dr. Julie Jones, Ralph Warner, and the many writings of others helped me to succeed.\nCounsel Hilary Malawer this is why CFR title 34, subtitle III, chapter III, part 300 subpart A, 300.34 related services must be modified to include \"Intervener services.\" With that person having training as a qualified intervener not the teacher assistant that's determined how the person is used in the IEP. The deaf blind person needs total support everyday all day. The intervenor is the eyes and ears for the deaf-blind person-section 504. I have related some of my experience when we advocate for our deaf blind children we are in fear of reprisal. This happened to me on many levels of injustice. Many victims hope this will change. Not making the process any harder than it already is. Eventually learning their child have aged out of the system without having an education to a cold and isolated world of loneliness. In the drama film \"Philadelphia\" of 1993 one of the first mainstreamed Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV\/Aids, Homosexuality and homophobia. This isolation that the disability causes is one of the grounds. The lawyer fought his case and won.\nPlease explain what is the difference in not recognizing the intervener for the deaf blind person? Discrimination is discrimination no matter how its hidden, So, are we hiding and turning our eyes and ears to the fact that we know deaf-blind persons cannot receive the proper support without the federal regulators getting involved\nHelen Keller was born June 27,1880 and died June 1,1968.

Any revision to the guidance for educational institutions should ensure everyone can feel safe learning. Victims should be able to trust that their institution will accurately inform them of their legal options and act in a timely manner to protect them.

As a social worker who has worked with sexual assault victims and currently adult men who commit sexual offenses, this is sadly more the case than not. To hold an expectation all victims of crime should report to the police is simply ignorant at best. In fact, the changes Sec DeVos proposes only serves to return the process of handling sexual assaults back to the stone age and further silences victims and places the rights of offenders above their victims. I have a client who's victim reported his sexually assaulting her while she was in and out of consciousness, due to intoxication. They were each students at a small college in Colorado.

The guidance issued by that document has helped to clarify the responsibilities of campuses to provide a timely and responsive system to address student conduct in regard to sexual misconduct.  I understand that the system might be difficult to navigate for those who are wrongly accused; however, I am curious as to why the focus of these proposed reforms is on a group of people who make up 2% of all rape cases? (See Attachment 1)\n\nTitle IX regulations have not created a failed system. I appreciate that during the announcement held on September 7 at George Mason University, Secretary DeVos shared stories of students for whom campus judicial processes caused more harm than good. Indeed, our organization has stood alongside many students for whom the campus judicial process was difficult or even mishandled. However, it is a spurious association to say that because some campuses did not handle investigations well, that we should do away with the system wholesale.

In spite of them not helping Dr. Julie Jones, Ralph Warner, and the many writings of others helped me to succeed.\nCounsel Hilary Malawer this is why CFR title 34, subtitle III, chapter III, part 309 subpart A, 300.34 related services must be modified to include \"Intervener services.\" With that person having training as a qualified intervener not the teacher assistant that's determined how the person is used in the IEP. The deaf blind person needs total support everyday all day. The intervenor is the eyes and ears for the deaf-blind person-section 504. I have related some of my experience when we advocate for our deaf blind children we are in fear of reprisal. This happened to me on many levels of injustice. Many victims hope this will change. Not making the process any harder than it already is. Eventually learning their child have aged out of the system without having an education to a cold and isolated world of loneliness. In the drama film \"Philadelphia\" of 1993 one of the first mainstreamed Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV\/Aids, Homosexuality and homophobia. This isolation that the disability causes is one of the grounds. The lawyer fought his case and won.\nPlease explain what is the difference in not recognizing the intervener for the deaf blind person? Discrimination is discrimination no matter how its hidden, So, are we hiding and turning our eyes and ears to the fact that we know deaf-blind persons cannot receive the proper support without the federal regulators getting involved\nHelen Keller was born June 27,1880 and died June 1,1968. She lived for 87 years long before my son was born in 1995. THE TIME IS NOW for the service of trained qualified interveners.\n","1959":"Responses to campus sexual assault must support survivors, uphold current available protections, and improve prevention.\nThere is worry that with existing regulations offenders are not given their due process, but they are. All institutions of higher education need to maintain campus processes with standards befitting a non-criminal, internal proceeding to respond to sexual misconduct. They nee do to make sure that their school does not allow those who choose to violate their classmate's rights and integrity to continue on there. That is WELL within the rights of schools and does not violate the rights of offenders.\nAttendance in higher ed is a privilege, not a right, and when you rape a classmate, you should lose that privilege, at least for as long as it takes your victim to complete their time there without fear that their rapist will continue to live in the room next to theirs, be in a class with them, etc. ","1960":"I stumbled across this forum by chance. After reading through a significant number of the posts I feel compelled to share my analysis. It seems to me that a system has evolved that allows an individual (generally a woman) to compel another (generally a man) to do something that he may not even be comfortable with, or is inly comfortable with doing that thing based on the first individual's actions and then the system allows the first person turn on the second person and say that the second person was acting in defiance of the first person's will. That sounds very dysfunctional to me. Compelling another to action and then, in the future, denying having done so is one of the hallmarks of psychological manipulation. Psychological manipulation is one of the primary forms of verbal\/emotional abuse. This is presents a very strong basis to those that have postulated that the current rules have created a new class of victims. Not that this have been recognized it is prudent that rules be established to protect the potential and actual victims of this verbal\/emotional abuse.

This clarification is important for schools and students alike to understand what obligations schools have, and to ensure Title IX is fairly and adequately enforced.

As an alumni who cares about eradicating sexual violence on college campuses, I believe that guidance like the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is critical in ensuring a fair process for all.\n\nEvery student deserves equal protection under the law to have an education free from discrimination, whether on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, disability status, English proficiency, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Because regulations issued by the Dept. of Education, Rehabilitation Service Administration last fall, for the purpose of WIOA implementation, have had unintentional job killing impact for people with disabilities.  Attaining competitive integrated employment is a goal for all individuals with disabilities  receiving vocational rehabilitation (VR) services in WIOA.  However, it appears the integrated location criterion in the final regulation is based on an overly simplistic and inaccurate understanding of the types of jobs that are provided through the AbilityOne program.  I am concerned that RSA is no longer recognizing employment in the AblityOne program as \"viable\" employment opportunity for people with disabilities because RSA incorrectly views these jobs as \"not typically found in the community\".  Over 18 states to date have stopped making referrals to AbilityOne jobs, even though they pay more than minimum wage and are an integrated setting.

The Department should explain how it uses the non-regulatory guidance to inform its monitoring, and remind states that the law grants them significant authority to make determinations regarding eligibility for and use of CSP subgrant funds (e.g., when determining whether a subgrant application is for a separate charter school or merely for additional grades at an existing charter school). This is particularly important since the law provides that the funds may be provided for new or significant expansion of charter public schools. \n2. Dissemination grants should be discontinued and replaced with an allowance for SEAs to spend up to 10 percent of grant funds on efforts to support the cultivation of demand for high-quality charter public schools. I.e., efforts to help parents understand what options are available and how to advocate for them. Simply telling families about the existence of CSP funds for charter school applicants doesn't do enough to inform parents of what could be made available for their children and communities. I'm not aware of any impact on closing achievement gaps through dissemination grant activities. There may be some (e.g., perhaps Houston Independent School District's charter-district collaboration came from dissemination grant funded activities), but I'm not aware of them. And the lengthy application requirements compared to limited funds usually dissuade strong charter school operators from applying. It would be wise, in my opinion, to have entities like charter support organizations apply for the 10% of funds from the SEA to help potential applicants build community support for their school applications.\n\nDocket IDED-2017-OS-0074\nI would like to share the following comments regarding the Department's Credit Enhancement Grant:\nI suggest considering how one of the benefits of having a public entity own or manage facilities for public entities is to save some of the public investment when the public entity (in this case a school operator) fails. I.e., if a charter public school is paying for facilities through such a program and eventually closes, the investment made into that facility is lost to the public. I don't think large urban school districts should continue to do as they have done and sink money into schools that they are unwilling to divest from when demand and supply are misaligned. However, I also worry when each individual school operator is spending the public money to buy or lease space with no possibility of retaining some of that investment if that school closes. There would be no inherent incentive for the financing entity to find another public interest entity to use the space. But, if the buildings were managed by a third party public entity (not a competing school operator or district), that entity could still use or lease the space to benefit the public (imagine a county health department taking over space vacated by a closed public school - charter or district operated).","1993":"I am commenting on: Regulation ID: ED-2015-OSERS-001-1167 Date Posted: Aug 19, 2016 RIN:1820-AB70\nCFR:34 CFR Parts 361, 363, and 397 Federal Register Number: 2016-15980\n\nIntegrated AbilityOne (JWOD) employment that includes full wages, benefits and promotional opportunities must be included in the definition of Competitive Integrated Employment\n\nThe Rehabilitation Services Administration regulatory re-definition of Competitive Integrated Employment;\n Restricts access to quality competitive, integrated jobs for people with significant disabilities.\n Is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, longstanding practice and technical guidance.\n Limits the ability of state Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program counselors to best determine the needs and competitive job fit for their individual clients with significant disabilities.\n Discriminates against non-profit employers of people with significant disabilities.\n Must be revised.\n\nSelected excerpts that overreach on defining the \"typically found in the community\" component of Competitive Integrated Employment and discriminate against non-profit employers (Community rehabilitation providers) of persons with disabilities\n\nFederal Register\/Vol. 81, No. 161\/Friday, August 19, 2016\/Rules and Regulations.

As iterated in ASCA's letter to you, student conduct on the vast majority of campuses is managed by professionals who have substantial experience in student affairs and applicable laws.  The Dear Colleague letter engaged our profession and encouraged us to consider the goal of equity in our processes.  As a result, we expanded the information and resources offered to accused students, allowed for participation by attorneys, moved to an investigation model, and generally balanced the support offered to both parties.  As a result of revising our procedures, we went from receiving an average of one request for investigation per year to over a dozen per year (we are a campus of 8500 students).  What this suggests to me is that the Dear Colleague Letter's focus on providing a procedure that is accessible to reporting parties, employs a trauma-informed approach, and that places emphasis on equity of both parties has created a process that students are more willing to engage when they believe they have been aggrieved (and far from what some may fear, we do not find every student reported to be in violation--in our most recent year, we found violations in about 50% of our cases).\n\nThe preponderance standard is the appropriate standard to employ, provided schools offer other protections for the accused such as adequate assistance and guidance, a role for attorneys to advise students who choose to employ them, notice and adequate opportunity to respond to all alleged violations, and the opportunity to present relevant information and witnesses.  I have heard no compelling argument that convinces me that the standard used in civil courts for any number of controversies, some of which involve serious injunctive relief or awards of damages in the millions of dollars, is inappropriate for colleges to use to determine if their own policies are violated (I note that this is also often the same standard used to determine whether employment action should taken, including termination, in employee cases).  Thus, I recommend that the standard of preponderance be retained as the appropriate standard.","1998":"The reinvigorated public activism of neo-Nazis and White supremacists should in itself make clear that we need continuously to enforce civil rights laws that protect equal access to education for all students, no matter their sex, race, ethnicity, religion, disability status, national origin or sexual orientation. \n\nAdded to this is the same old lightly-concealed obligato of sexism, gender-baiting, racism, christocentrism, ableism, and hatred of immigrants.\n\nWe need educational systems that are genuinely open to all, no longer requiring students to walk a gauntlet of noisy antagonists as Ruby Bridges did. \n\nWe need them for justice, and so all our residents can develop their talents and abilities, and both those things make our nation strong and great.\n\nIf continued vigilance requires fewer interventions, great!

When a school or a school district doesn't treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the U.S. Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\nOur education system is unfair and inequitable to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to solve that problem and make sure ALL children get the fair and equitable education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\nIt's the Department of Education's job to help our nation's schools provide high-quality, equitable education for all children. America should be a place where every child, no matter their unique challenges, their unique needs, or where they come from, can grow up to be what they dream.\n\nSincerely,\nDan Drmacich, Retired Principal of  Rochester School Without Walls\nCo-Chair of Rochester Coalition for Public Education\n","2009":"We must protect equal access to education for all students, no matter their sex, race, ethnicity, religion, disability status, national origin or sexual orientation.\nWe cannot sit silently while Education Secretary DeVos tries to weaken 50 years of civil rights laws, key regulations that we have fought for so long to enact, protect and advance.

As someone whose advocacy has spanned 3 decades, I have been heartened by the commitment of the federal government to put its money where its mouth is with respect to safeguarding the right of all students in federally funded institutions to pursue their education in an environment free of gender discrimination, whether bias, harassment or violence.  As an advocate and a parent, I have seen too many situations where schools flat out got it wrong, failed to protect students and too often, left them to fend for themselves when federal oversight and intervention was appropriate and desperately needed. Schools need to understand what is required of them, though too often, that is not the case. \n\nJust yesterday, I was involved in a lengthy exchange on social media where people where opining about whether a young man accused of sexual violence should be suspended from his high school athletic team.  One person said, \"all athletes should be treated the same,\" which sounds good in theory, but is much less than is required by Title IX.  The school in question should have had policies that set forth how such cases would be handled, and what policies, procedures and protections the school would use to ensure that both sides were given a full opportunity to be heard (and in the instance of the accused) a full opportunity to know beforehand what the allegations and\/or charges were. And as importantly, the school should have enforced its policy consistently with respect to all similarly situated cases that it confronted. Schools need to understand their obligation to enforce the federal law (and regulations\/guidance that have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law) just as much as students need to know that the Department of Education will be there to vindicate their rights should their schools fail them. I stand in full support of the currently existing approach (including the Dear Colleagues and other documents) to enforcing civil rights protections under Title IX, and am I opposed to any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nI similarly voice support for continued vigorous enforcement of anti-discrimination laws that address discrimination or bias on the basis of race, disability, religion or national origin. \n\nFinally, I think the federal government failed transgender students earlier this year when it withdrew the guidance that had been promulgated by the Departments of Education and Justice on that subject. Transgender students are no less deserving of the protections of federal law than any other group of students, and particularly as they have been victimized by bias and discrimination, the federal government should have continued to make all efforts to stand up for them, including defending the guidance before the US Supreme Court in the GG case.  Please make every effort to reinstate the guidance or to issue other documents that let schools know of their obligations to treat transgender students in a manner consistent with those students' gender identity, including but not limited to their use of appropriate bathroom and locker room changing facilities. \n\nI hope that the US Department of Education will continue to zealously carry out its mission to enforce federal education-related civil rights protections to the end that any and all bias-related barriers to student access to a sound educational environment are removed. \nSincerely,\n\nLisalyn R.

","2123":"Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,\n\nI grew up taking Title IX for granted, and I was in the first generation to do this: I assumed throughout my school career K-12 that it was only fair that women's sports existed and options mirrored the men's sports options. I assumed that I could go out for any team, and that I had the right to learn anything my high school offered in course or extracurricular format. This freedom made me a confident and successful student and later worker and now small business owner. It was a fight (and I understood that as well; there were still some saying that women shouldn't play sports, or that if a girl played too well she was a lesbian obviously--even within the teams themselves there was enforcing and harassment of this kind), but it was a fight that I felt we were all winning. My mind was opened, and I felt sure that we were on the path to opening educational resources to everyone, regardless of sex\/gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, English language ability (yes, I learned well that the new Chinese student in my math class was very intelligent and fun to speak with despite her beginners' English, and that she was learning English better than I was learning Spanish in my other courses). I eventually even came out as a lesbian--although it took me into my 30s to be able to cope with this idea effectively, due to the imperfect way that I'd been introduced, the imperfect but improving learning environment that had been offered to me.\n\nPlease do not take this hopeful, encouraging, open-minded atmosphere away from future generations of students. It was only a few years before my time that my older sister grew up in a very different environment, and had to deal with many more struggles and challenges to her face because of gender. And my mother grew up in a world where it took an act of courage to simply move out of her parents' house and get an apartment with a friend, and start a work life as a teacher. I never want to go back to that period, and I don't think you do, either.\n\nCurrent federal regulations and guidance help all studentsregardless of sex, race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, or disability statusreceive the benefit of our civil rights laws.

Not only does it help make the process fair for survivors, it makes it fair and clear for those accused of sexual assault.\n\nEvery student deserves equal protection under the law to have an education free from discrimination, whether on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, disability status, English proficiency, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Strong enforcement of Title II, VI and IX from the Department of Education is increasingly necessary. Please protect the civil rights of students by maintaining all existing guidance and regulations.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLaura Meyer","2171":"OCR should overhaul the regulations governing Title IX prosecutions on college campuses. I have six suggestions:\nFirst, the presumption of innocence no longer exists. When the DCL established \"preponderance\" as the burden of proof and the Cleary Act shifted to \"victim-centric,\" colleges took this as a signal that accused students must prove their innocence, rather than be presumed innocent. OCR needs to send a very clear message that students should not be found responsible unless there is actual evidence of misconduct. \nSecond, Title IX administrators disregard OCR rules and college policies and there is no way to hold them accountable. Investigations drag on for months with no complicating factors such as police investigation. Accused students are in damaging limbo for months and months for no reason. TIXCs also prejudge outcomes and communicate the desired outcome to hearing panels and others before the hearing even occurs. We need a simple mechanism to require TIXCs to follow the rules and be held accountable when they don't follow them. \nThird, accused students are not given the opportunity to defend themselves. Most of these cases lack evidence or witnesses other than the accused and the accuser. But, the accused is not allowed to question the accuser, the accused cannot introduce evidence of consent such as an existing sexual relationship between the parties, and the accusers actions while drinking are simply ignored even though there is no other evidence. If you are going to hold young men accountable for sex when they are drinking when no force is shown, why isn't the young woman accountable for her own actions?\nFourth, relying on college administrators to be investigators assumes that someone can be effective detectives with only a few meaningless hours of training. Require colleges to use trained investigators such as ex police officers.\nFifth, most college families are scraping by. Hiring an attorney is simply not an option for most families. Colleges should be required to provide independent legal counsel for the Title IX process. Otherwise, wealth rather than evidence decides cases.\nSixth, boys found responsible under existing rules should be expunged. If the college believes there is actual wrong doing, they can retry the case under the new rules. No one will get away with anything. Title IX has already destroyed their reputations and altered their lives forever. Expunge their records and let them start rebuilding their lives.","2172":"Citation: CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nI request a modification of the regulations to include intervener services on the list of Related Services. As the friend of someone who is raising a DeafBlind child, I have witnessed the incredible uphill battle necessary for her child to get the accessibility resources that she needs and deserves in order to fully access education. I am someone who is lucky to process the world in ways that are privileged within the school system. As a result, I never struggled to learn with the resources provided in school - they fit me well, and so I loved school and thrived at school, and school laid a foundation for me to reach a fulfilled adulthood. The same is not true now in our school system for DeafBlind children, who are systematically denied the services they need so that the learning environment at school can work for them. \n\nI want my friend's child to love school, to thrive in school, and the grow up into a fulfilled adulthood.

My son is deaf blind just graduated from High School at the age of 22. We fought many years for an intervener who is trained in deaf blindness, and only received one for the last 2 years of his 8 years in high school. My son is deaf blind and they provided an interpreter. They signed very fast and didn't understand deaf blindness. Didn't understand to hold their hangs when signing in a certain location, and to slow down so he had a chance to understand what they were signing. My son was not engaged, he was not aware of his surroundings, and we had many issues with behavior for most of his high school years. An intervener is educated in deaf\/blindness and our sons world changed when he was assigned an intervener. He was more aware of what was going on in the classroom, and was more engaged. He made big strides during his last few years, and our behavior issues were reduced by 80%.

","2232":"To:Hilary Malawer, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Education\nFrom:Dr. William J. Lennox Jr., President of Saint Leo University\nRe:Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\n\nI thank the Department of Education and Secretary Devos for their leadership in seeking to reduce the regulatory burden on higher education institutions.\n\nOver the last eight years, Department of Education regulations and \"guidance\" have burdened institutions of higher education with unfunded mandates that have inflated their budgets and diverted resources away from studentsthe very people our mission demands we are to serve.  \n\nFinancial Responsibility Standards: The federal system for assessing the financial soundness of non-profit colleges is outdated. The Department of Educations implementation of the current financial responsibility regulations has forced many institutions that are not at risk of precipitous closure to waste limited funds on securing expensive letters of credit. The Department has not fixed the problems, despite well-documented evidence that it is not following the generally accepted accounting principles required by law.  In addition, new regulatory provisions have been tied to financial responsibility, heightening the need to fix the standards. Finally, new nonprofit accounting standards have been promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), scheduled to be implemented by Saint Leo University and other colleges and universities by FY2018-19; the financial responsibility composite score calculations must consider these changes.  These changes will greatly affect liquidity and other key financial ratios largely due to changes in lease standards, revenue recognition, and net asset classifications and segregation.  Our ratios will be adjusted to reflect these changes such as the exclusion of restricted net assets and cash and changes in debt coverage due to the leasing standards resulting in increased liabilities for future financial reporting. \n\nDeregulation. In 2015, The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities participated in the Task Force on the Federal Regulation of Higher Education, which made recommendations to consolidate, streamline, and eliminate burdensome regulations. Saint Leo University endorses this report particularly in regards to the burdensome reporting, especially the amount of detail required for enrollment reporting.\n\nAlso, each October the federal government changes the interest rates on student loans by miniscule percentage point, causing a massive rework for our financial aid team and requiring one to two weeks for us to accomplish.  \n\nSemester-based\/term based financial aid processing.  Saint Leo University also suggests reworking the processing for federal aid to be semester or term based.  This will allow students maximum financial aid eligibility to attend school during the summer.  It will also create a standardized process for all funds to release the administrative burden in the financial aid office.  As it stands the regulations and process for Pell Grants works one way, student loans another, SEOG another, etc.\n\nState Authorization Reciprocity Agreement.  Though the state of Florida has agreed to sign onto the National Council of State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements, the fact that Saint Leo University enrolls students in all 50 states through our online program, these rules have cost us a significant amount of time and money to meet and monitor requirements in all states. These are resources that could be better used to serve our students.  \n\nAgain, thank you for seeking input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification. \n","2233":"\"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\"\n\nI request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.

Although he had a different staff assigned to him every day because of his specific needs, no one was consistent and the staff's knowledge of sign language varied from person to person. ELA was exceptionally hard for him because he had such limited experiences in life and if he was lucky enough to have the words signed to him, he didn't know what they meant.  So basically, his educational needs were not being met.  Children who are able to see and hear learn mostly through incidental learning.  Children who are deaf-blind need direct learning experiences.  Therefore, a student who id deaf-blind misses out on 90% of learning or instruction that is taught primarily through secondasy learing.\n\nAn Intervener would specialize in the communication methods used by the student, adapt and modify lesson plans to meet the need of the student, serve as a bridge between the student and others allowing them to expand on the number of communication partners the student can have, set up routines where there is exposure to consistent language building (receptive and expressive), meet the student's unique sensory needs, and provide consistent feedback and expectations for the student.\n\nMy student has tremendously benefited from having an Intervener.  He went from using tactile symbols and in hand sign language to using words and pictures.  He has progressed in all areas of academics so much that our school has named him the \"Celebrating Success\" student for several years.  He has really come out of his shell and is now volunteering in the community as he transitions into a secondary classroom.  His behavior plan has been dropped because he is no longer displaying aggressive\/non-compliant behaviors at school or at home.  Most of all, he is happy and included!  he has someone able to give him access to information he may have missed because he can not hear and is legally blind. \n\nI strongly urge this regulation to include Intervener as a related service on the IEP because without an Intervener we are not meeting the law granting the deaf-blind student Free and Appropriate public education.  These students deserve this right just as other students.\n\n","2234":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A,  300.34 Related Services\n\nI request modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.  Having worked with deafblind students, I can attest to the value of a professional who is atuned to what an individual student understands and how he or she understands it in relation to the nature and extent of the student's sensory impairment.  Data show that for many disabilities, compensatory skills can be developed to compensate such that the disability only minimally or if all inhibits quality of life and opportunity for full participation as a citizen.  That is not so for those with dual sensory impairment conditions.  For these students, the earlier and more consistently a specially intervener can be provided, the better the transition outcomes for students. A well-trained Intervener is a life-line for the student and the student's liaison to other IEP team members.","2235":"There can not be any argument that sexual violence is acceptable in any form. However The standards that the 2011 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" have resulted in are an abomination to justice in any civilized society. The level of proof required to find a student responsible for a Title IX violation is paltry at best. Accused students as well as Accusers deserve to have their case heard by a fair an impartial panel that is law trained and they deserve to be represented by counsel. I urge the Department to rescind the \"Dear Colleague Letter\" raise the standard of proof, require law trained panels and allow for representation of both sides by legal counsel. Sexual assault is horrendous but placing the responding side at a distinct disadvantage does nothing to end assault and only serves to cause them to forever question the findings of a hearing board.","2236":"Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,\n\nHow dare you seek to end the civil rights of young people in this country?! SHAME ON YOU. All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary. Far from being burdensome, current civil rights rules and regulations  benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that, when followed, allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex, race, color, national origin, disability status, English proficiency, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\nI urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C.F.R. pts. 1 thru 1299 , which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights; Elementary and Secondary Education; Special Education and Rehabilitative Services; Career, Technical, and Adult Education; Post-Secondary Education; Educational Research and Improvement; and the National Council on Disability. \n\nI also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents, including guidance on sexual, racial, and disability-based harassment (including guidance on sexual violence); access to athletic opportunities; gender equity in career and technical education; single-sex schools; equal access to educational resources; nondiscriminatory school discipline; racial diversity programs; the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools; restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities; and the rights of English language learners. I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place, and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive.\n\nSincerely,\nsarah foster\n  Brooklyn, NY 11216","2237":"please eliminate \"Dear College letters\"!","2238":"To whom it may concern: \n\nI am writing here today to bring attention to the \"2011 Dear Colleague Letter.\" (2011 DCL)  I'm sure there are many people that agree with the 2011 guidance. In some ways, it was a commendable action. I agree there absolutely needs to be some sort of Title IX guidance put on the Universities to ensure they are creating a safe environment for all types of students regardless of gender, orientation, race, etc. These are rights that should be shared as human beings across the board, especially as it pertains to your right to education. However, though well-intended, the '2011 Dear Colleague Letter' is deeply flawed and is creating a new class of victims. \n\nIn an effort to avoid a long response, I'm going highlight the faults of the 2011 Dear College Letter. The issues are as followed: \n\n1. It discriminates against men (especially men of color). \n2. Universities don't know how to give adequate due process. Cross-examination is strongly discouraged. \n3. Standard of evidence is too low. All Universities need for evidence is a story. No other forms of evidence are needed to determine fault. \n3.Universities are pressured to find someone accountable for ANY 'concerning' action because they fear title ix lawsuits from the complainant. This creates a conflict of interest. Universities do what offers them the least backlash. \n4.Universities hire like-minded individuals to create a powerful circle of confirmation bias. There is no diversity of opinion or thought. \n\nAlso, I hear the argument made countless times that false reports are low enough to a level where it can be considered negligible or irrelevant. This usually mentioned when talking about rape accusations.So, let consider the group of people who are victims of false reports. Regardless of the numbers, when has it ever been ok to ignore a group of people because their numbers are too low? You must also understand that Title IX cases don't account for just rape. Title IX deals with much more than just rape, it revolves around many things. \n\nMen who are victims of false accusations and a biased system against them have to face lifelong consequences. Many people try to downgrade these consequences because they claim educational sanctions aren't that traumatic. This is false. If a student has been expelled for suspended, they may never get accepted from another institution again. Their chances of getting a degree are vastly lower than other males. This has a compounded effect on their ability to find a career. This is also ignoring the traumatic emotional issues these young men can develop from a false accusation or ill-founded sanction. Many of these young men are indeed victims themselves, and yet they come out of a Title IX cases portrayed as a monster. \n\nI am happy to see that Universities are finally trying to get a handle of these cases. However, overcorrection can cause more harm than good. We need to create a system that guarantees due process for both complainants and respondents. We need a system that does not single out men, especially men of color, simply based on generalizations of guilt. We need universities to not feel pressured that they HAVE to find a young man accountable because they fear a lawsuit or backlash. ","2239":"The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter has become synonymous with male gender bias and kangaroo court.  It is now a verb:  To Title IX a guy for bad behavior.  Many have gotten males expelled or suspended until after they would graduate.  It is NOT what America stands for!  We care about due process and the order of law!  And we also care about each individual possessing agency over their own decisions.","2240":"\nRecommendations:\n \nBefore commencement of any investigation, parties should be given information regarding legal options and consequences, both in writing and orally.  The survivor must be informed of legal options, including the ability to sue the accused in tort in order to recover damages and to obtain a civil protection order as an alternative or as a compliment to the Title IX process.  Survivors and the accused must be made aware that the school may or will report the incident(s) to the police, which could trigger criminal charges being filed against the accused, even over the survivor's objections. The responding student must be informed, prior to the commencement of any process, that the allegations, if proven, could result in criminal charges being filed against the responding student.  In addition, the responding student should be advised that other civil consequences could result, such as an action by the complaining student seeking financial damages.\n\nBoth parties must be informed that they may seek the advice of counsel prior to the commencement of the investigatory process. \n\nInform both parties prior to the commencement of the Title IX process whether the allegations have been or will be reported to the police or any other criminal justice system players. \n\nBoth students face difficult decisions on whether to participate in Title IX proceedings when criminal charges may be filed.  This dilemma is particularly burdensome for the responding student. Title IX and any related statute should be amended to require that none of the evidence (verbal or written) provided by the student alleging harm and the accused shall be used as evidence in any related criminal proceeding. This amendment would eliminate concern that participation in proceedings would form a basis for a criminal complaint to issue.  Additionally, the adjudicator(s) would be more likely to receive all pertinent information if both the student alleging harm and the accused participate in the process.  This statutory amendment would assist survivors who may wish to participate in subsequent criminal proceedings but are concerned that statements made during the Title IX process would be used against them at any subsequent criminal hearing.  This is of particular concern if the harmed student is still experiencing memory disorganization and other traumatic consequences at the time of the Title IX hearing.\n\nWhen the investigator's report is prepared, but prior to its finalization or distribution to any third-party decision-maker,  the reporting and responding students have an opportunity to review the report.  The harmed student as well as the accused students shall have an opportunity to respond to any factual information that the student finds inaccurate.  The students may suggest additional witnesses to be interviewed or other evidence reviewed that might counter information a student deems incorrect.  The student and investigator's responses should be noted in the report.  \n\nThose whose expertise is in sexual and intimate partner abuse should be included as decision-makers.  Those in the field are expert not only in what is gender violence but also, they are the ones who can best screen out what is not gender violence. Often these experts are omitted from panels because they are presumed to be biased.  This presumption is an extension of mythologies that those whose fields include gender violence or other feminist based studies hate men and will always support the student claiming to have been harmed.  These perceptions are extensions of the mythology that women lie about sexual assault, a myth that has been debunked in all reliable studies.\n\nAdjudicators must be properly trained and not have a conflict with administrators that fear loss of DOE funding if the accused is found \"not responsible\". \n  \nExpand the number of  adjudicatory panel members from three to five, where possible, will permit greater diversity to  panels including racially diversity and those with diverse sexualities and abilities.  This diversity will strengthen the panel's ability to sort out the biases and misconceptions.  Decisions should be by majority vote.\n  \nReasons for appeal as voiced by the American Bar Association's Criminal Justice Section have merit and should apply to both the student claiming harm as well as the student accused of causing harm.  Students need the right to appeal the finding of a Title IX decision-maker where the finding of \"responsible or not responsible\" has no basis in the evidence presented.  Most other CJS recommendations are not endorsed. The preponderance of the evidence standard should be retained. Unsupported findings are often related to the inappropriateness of an unqualified decision maker and are unrelated to the POE standard.\n\nFor further comment please see my article to be published this fall by the University of Tennessee College of Law \"\"It's Not Complicated\"  See UMass Law Scholarship Repository for a draft.\n\n ","2241":"\"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nI request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services. \n\nInterveners provide students with deaf-blindness access to environment information that is usually gained through vision and hearing, but which is unavailable or incomplete to the child.

Instead, it wielded a threat to universities to withhold money if they didn't comply with the requirements of the letter. Six years later, hundreds of students find themselves in campus kangaroo courts or star chambers, without representation, without full knowledge or understanding of the accusation, without ability to cross examine their accuser, without trained investigators, without a judge to oversee the proceedings and without a jury of their peers. Universities appoint investigators who are campus administrators \"trained\" in Title IX. Any student can now make a false accusation that will result in the expulsion of another student and take away their life ambitions, scholarships, and educational opportunities at current and future schools. The Dear Colleague Letter does not address consequences of false allegation. Universities are not equipped to investigate a case like our law enforcement. If a crime has been committed, it should be reported to law enforcement. To prove that these cases are true or false must be governed by the due process laws that have always governed our country. Please eliminate the Dear Colleague Letter and leave these cases to our law enforcement professionals. The seriousness of these consequences requires that you implement appropriate due process for the rights of the entire student body, including the accused.","2244":"The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is a weapon of government intimidation intended to terrify all male university students by making it clear that guilt or innocence is not a factor in being expelled. Statements in publications such as the website VOX states something like this, \"we will ruin a few innocent lives but that's the price of putting fear into everyone else\". This is government abuse of power with little regard for the consequences. To remove the protection of due process is clearly not in the interest of fairness but an intention to punish anyone who can be gathered in from an accusation including those that lack credibility. The injustice is obvious, which tends to justify your investigation of the intention behind this ridiculous, unlawful, extortion plot motivated by radicals in the previous administration.\n","2245":"Hello, \n\nI would like to request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.

I am attaching my son's story showing the bias and inequities in the system and how my son was treated along with a copy of my son's student rights at his college. \nTrauma Informed Prevention is the \"Public Health Perspective\" that has taken hold over the last eight years. This thought process is pervasive throughout the CDC and the DOJ. Many of these studies seem to have been funded through the VAWA. A Trauma Informed Approach according to the Director of Community Living on our campus states; \"It guides us to approach all students as though they have experienced abuse, regardless of whether they have or not.\" I feel like I need to repeat that. Treat the student as though they have been assaulted even if they have not. It only matters that they believe they were assaulted. Is it not important to look at both sides? Title IX is about fair and equal treatment. Why are we not using more evidenced based studies like the Rape and Sexual Assault Victimization Among College-Age Females, 1995-2013.\nA Highlight of Activities report for the OCR 2009-2016 was recently released. It states there was a 1,170% increase in the number of Sexual Violence related complaints from 2009 to 2016.  The Obama administration has focused on prevention of sexual assault and violence. How is this huge increase in \"sexual violence\" considered an accomplishment? How are we helping the \"victims\"? It seems that the problem is expanding. I know the colleges are proud of their increased numbers stating people feel comfortable now to report their assault. It seems more believable that the number of assaults is increased because of the expanded definitions of the words \"sexual assault and \"rape\"?\" The CDC states, \"Sexual violence includes a continuum of behaviors such as attempted or completed rape, sexual coercion, unwanted contact, and non-contact unwanted experiences like harassment.\"  Including \"non-contact unwanted experiences like harassment\" certainly increases the numbers. Add to this the preponderance of evidence standard and our sons are much more likely to be found guilty! Is it ok with you that a young man found responsible for a non-contact experience potentially will suffer life long effects with his career or worse? Think of the stigma of being labeled a sex offender it is embarrassing, humiliating, it is an emotional scar that does not go away. Depression, suicide and PTSD are common. Your life is sidelined for months to even years with this process and they cannot return what was taken away even if the final verdict is not guilty. This is a life-changing event with a life sentence. \nThe college has pressure to meet statistics so that they can continue to receive Federal Grant money. How does this make the college fair and impartial? We need to remove the potential bias of college administrators\/faculty\/students who sit on these hearing panels and could be pressured into making the best decision for the college and ultimately their own jobs.\nThe fact is believe the victim at all costs, combined with the inflated definitions of the words \"rape\" and \"sexual assault\", throw in affirmative consent and preponderance of evidence standard without providing all due process rights and yes we have a kangaroo court. Title IX should not be in the business of deciding a young mans future. Please repeal the DCL! We need to return these investigations to trained professionals in the criminal justice system!  Rape or Sexual assault is a serious crime! Why are we letting college professors\/administrators or students determine these outcomes? I ask where is the common sense in this? The current system is not fair to the victims or to the accused. Please repeal the DCL and it current guidance! \n\n","2252":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nI respectfully request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of \"Related Services\".  \n\nDue to the low incidence nature of deafblindness, the needs of these children to have a qualified intervener as part of FAPE are poorly understood.  Moreover, it unfortunately seems many local education agencies  are not aware of what intervener services are and are hesitant to provide them, which is a detriment to the students requiring these services.  \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","2253":"There are many \"comments\" that aren't original.  They're just copies of comments originally posted weeks\/months ago.  Obviously this is part of a campaign to retain the rules as they are no matter that at least some of them are designed to \"persuade\" colleges\/universities to run kangaroo courts.  That is shameful.  The American people are not stupid (at least not all the time).  We don't need to be compelled to run kangaroo courts to ensure civil rights.  Those who think we do (the \"authors\" of the many copies of the \"leave everything alone\" comments) may not realize that kangaroo courts deprive their defendants of their most basic civil right, the right to be considered innocent until PROVEN guilty.  The results of kangaroo courts are not PROOFS of guilt; they are acts of tyranny.  ","2254":"We very much appreciate the opportunity to offer suggestions on the long overdue reconsideration of Title IX prosecutions.\n\nOur main request is that you require colleges to expunge findings made against students unless the college is able to show that the prosecution: 1) was not discriminatory, 2) followed the college's own policies, 3) complied with OCR rules, and 4) met the OCR's stated goals of fairness, impartiality, and truth. We know our son was prosecuted unfairly and we can prove it, but our college opted to ignore misconduct by its own Title IX office so as to not be seen as interfering. So much for our son's guarantee of fair treatment. \n\nWhile it may seem \"upside down\" to place the burden on the colleges to prove that they acted in accordance with their own policies and the law, it is a very real issue that colleges have been improperly prosecuting male students for years. These boys have suffered loss of academic futures, loss of career options, devastating damage to their reputations, and severe\nemotional distress. We all agree that sexual assault should be punished, but male students are being punished in kangaroo courts, by unskilled personnel, for acts that would not be sexual assault in the real world.\n\nOur specific story differs from most Title IX prosecutions. No alcohol, drugs, weapons, physical harm, or other aggravating facts were involved. Instead, our case involved a \"he said\/she said\" sexual encounter, an angry ex-girlfriend, and a Title IX office that believes that it has carte blanche to prosecute male students while ignoring the presumption of innocence, ignoring exculpatory evidence, ignoring her stated intent to punish him for their break-up, ignoring the sexual history between the parties, ignoring the college's own policies, and ignoring OCR rules.\n\nAs stated above, our main request is to ask that colleges be required to expunge the records of students prosecuted under Title IX unless the college can prove that the prosecution was unbiased, fair, complied with the college's own policy, and complied with OCR rules. Our son and many other male students have been improperly prosecuted and have already suffered greatly. We ask that you begin the process of helping them rebuild their lives by expunging their records.\n\nIn addition, based on our experience, there are a six changes that need to be made to the Title IX prosecution process to make it more transparent and more likely to reach the truth:\n\n1. Move the burden of proof to \"clear and convincing evidence.\" We believe this step is required because Title IX offices have an ingrained belief that \"boys lie, and girls do not.\" Unless you move the standard higher, more boys will have their lives and careers destroyed based on unsubstantiated accusations. In other words, a higher burden of proof is needed just to ensure that male students have the basic right of a presumption of innocence andthat evidence will actually be required to sanction them.\n\n2. Require a basic set of due process protections in a Title IX prosecution  ones that cannot be side-stepped by a Title IX office when it finds it inconvenient to find actual evidence and to be impartial. Basic due process should include: a ban on hearsay, that all testimony be given under oath and be subject to perjury rules, the right to cross examine witnesses, the\nright to see all evidence and know all charges before the hearing, the right to counsel who can participate in the hearing as he\/she would in a trial, and a requirement that the hearing board and any appeal board not be staffed by employees who work in the same department as the Title IX office.\n\n3. Impose on the General Counsel and President of the college the obligation to ensure that the college's policies and OCR rules are followed and that there are processes in place to ensure impartiality and basic fairness. The General Counsel and the President of the college should police the Title IX office, not the students and parents who have little time, money, and knowledge.\n\n4. Require the Hearing Board to identify the evidence that it relied on, how the standard of proof was met, and include this analysis in the FOL so that students can learn why they were found responsible and thereby have a meaningful right to appeal.\n\n5. Create an appeal structure that is truly neutral, and include the right to challenge both the process and the substantive finding.\n\n6. Require that the college inform both students and parents at the outset of the investigation of the allegations, possible sanctions, the process to be followed, due process rights, timing and appeal rights. Any privacy concerns can be dealt with by having forms signed at the start of college. We, for example, were never notified by our college about the possibility of an appeal to the OCR.\n\nThank you for your consideration. We provide these comments anonymously because our son's case has not been made public and because we fear more retaliation from our Title IX office.","2255":"Ms. Hilary Malawer\nAssistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel\nU.S. Department of Education\n400 Maryland Ave SW., Room 6E231\nWashington, DC 20202\nVia electronic submission at http:\/\/www.regulations.gov\nRe: Docket ID: ED-2017-OS-0074\n\nDear Ms. Malawer:\n\nThis is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.\n\nThese regulations and guidance are disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program.  We are one of those agencies.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Disability Statistics Annual Report, the employment percentage for people with disabilities was 34.9%; the percentage for people without disabilities was 76% in the US in 2015.  Unfortunately, there continues to be a growing gap in employment between those with and without disabilities since 2008.  While Hawaii currently has a very low unemployment rate, the gap in employment between those with and without disabilities mirrors that of the country.  \n\nConsidering the disproportionately low employment rate amongst those with disabilities, it is troubling to see the RSA language further restricting employment opportunities for those with disabilities. The language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance. \n\nBased on this language, Hawaiis vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency is one of at least 19 states' VR that have stopped referring and placing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program.  Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased, individuals with significant disabilities are being denied the choice to work at these competitive wage opportunities.\n\nWe request the DoEd rescind the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance.  Employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne program, should be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that have the unintended consequence of eliminating jobs, or inhibit job creation for those most in need.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarian E.

Founded in 1975, PCAR works with a network of 50 sexual assault centers that bring help, hope, and healing to all of the Commonwealth's 67 counties. We operate the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, which provides the nation with sexual violence prevention training and technical assistance. \nPCAR wishes to submit comments on the following two guidance documents under current review by the U.S. Department of Education: \n1.)2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Title IX Requirements and How They Relate to Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence: https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/ocr\/letters\/colleague-201104.pdf \n2.)2016 Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students: https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/ocr\/letters\/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf \n\nTitle IX protects the entire campus communityacross gender identitiesand ensures that schools are equipped to both prevent and remedy gender-based discrimination. The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR) opposes any scaling back or dilution of the Department of Education 2011 and 2016 guidance. \n\nPCAR would like to draw specific attention to three areas of concern in its comments: \n\n1.)Standard of Evidence: The preponderance standard is used in other campus student misconduct proceedings for vandalism, possession\/use of illegal substances, physical assault, and others. This standard of evidence has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in civil matters. PCAR supports the preponderance of the evidence standard, as it is consistent with other school conduct proceedings and civil matters. Weakening this standard only for sexual violence investigations would be problematic on many levels: it would be a departure from the norm in campus adjudication and civil proceedings; it would leave victims of sexual violence without critical remedies; and it would endanger the larger campus community. Weakening this standard would move us backwards to a time when sexual violence was brushed under the rug and victims were not believed. \n\n2.)Reporting options: Individuals who report sexual violence must be notified of their rights to report to both the campus authorities as well as law enforcement. However, the campus and criminal justice proceedings are purposefully distinct. Even if an incident is reported to law enforcement, a school is still obligated, under Title IX, to investigate, respond, and resolve all reports of sex discrimination in a timely manner. PCAR supports victims' rights to report to both law enforcement and\/or their campus personnel. We reject any guidance or policies that require all reports to solely go to law enforcement. Sexual violence is the most underreported violent crime in the U.S. Over 80% of students never report. Restricting any option for reporting will only exacerbate this fact and further isolate victims from the support and safety they deserve and need. \n\n3.)Rights of transgender students: Title IX applies to students across all gender identities, including transgender students. The 2016 guidance clarifies and reinforces this message, requiring schools to treat students in ways that are consistent with their gender identities. Any harassment of a student based on their gender identity or denial of educational programming or activities based on that gender identity is discriminatory and harmful and must be remedied. PCAR supports the 2016 guidance and the rights of transgender students to have access to a safe, nondiscriminatory environment where they learn, live, socialize, and compete as athletes. It is well-known that transgender students are at greater risk for being sexually victimized and harassed than their cisgender counterpartswhether in a restroom or walking to class. All students have the right to an education free from sexual harassment and violence. Any dilution of the 2016 guidance will be a dangerous step backwards as a nation, leaving students who identify as transgender at risk for violence, interrupted education, and a myriad of potential harmful consequences. \n\nIn closing, PCAR supports the ongoing implementation and enforcement of Title IX and opposes any efforts to scale back Department of Education guidance from 2011 and 2016. All students must be afforded their rights to an education free from sexual harassment and violence, across gender identities. When sexual violence does occur, victims must have the right to report it to their schools and\/or to local law enforcement; to access confidential supportive services and care; and to seek remedies that enable them to continue their educational programs and activities. Any dilution of Title IX enforcement would send us backwards as a nation. We owe it to our students to ensure their educational pursuits are free from sexual violence. \n\n","2258":"We are Cynthia Grant Bowman, the Dorothea S. Clarke Professor of Feminist Jurisprudence, and Kevin M. Clermont, the Robert D. Ziff Professor of Law, at Cornell Law School. Professor Bowman originated the corps of law students who counsel complainants in Cornell University's system for adjudicating complaints of sexual abuse and also for several years presided over the tribunal that heard appeals from campus disciplinary code violations, in which capacities she became familiar with the adjudication of sexual assault matters. Professor Clermont was the original advisor, and remains so, of the corps of law students who defend respondents in that system and is a prominent scholar in the area of civil procedure.  We are both very concerned about the serious problem of sexual assault on U.S. campuses and committed to addressing it, with a goal that all students have an equal opportunity to pursue their education without fear of threats to their well being.\n\nWe have observed the Cornell University system for over a decade. It currently takes the form typically prevailing in major universities since the Dear Colleague Letter. We will spare you the detail, and instead just resoundingly report that Cornell's system is not close to working for anyone, whether accuser, accused, or the public. Procedural injustice is the norm, and substantive injustice is all too common.\n\nThe path to reform clearly must begin by retracting the illegal and ill-conceived Dear Colleague Letter. Universities must be allowed to experiment and innovate, within the mandate of Title IX. \n\nIf the current adjudicatory system prevails, some minimal guarantees of due process must be provided: Both parties must be allowed to cross-examine the other's witnesses, even if the two parties themselves are not present in the same room.  A legal representative on behalf of each party must be allowed to speak on their behalf in the proceedings. Each must have access to all evidence to be presented on behalf of the other party.  And universities and colleges should be free to set the standard of proof in these matters, preferably to be consistent with the standard used in other disciplinary proceedings on their respective campuses and to be proportionate to the severity of the sanction potentially to be imposed for the violation charged.\n\nOur own views have migrated (a long way) in the last few years, so that we in fact favor the introduction of restorative justice procedures as the entry point to the system, although either party could escalate to the full adjudicatory procedure.  The Dear Colleague Letter appears to prohibit any such move. Remove the roadblock.\n\n","2259":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services: \n\nPublic schools do not have the experience, training, or staff to truly provide an appropriate education for deaf\/blind students (and students with many other disabilities as well).

When a school or a school district doesnt treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. \n\nI oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nAs a recent UC college graduate and advocate serving the small rural community of Gilroy where I was born and raised, these protections are vital to the sustainability and prosperity if our community. Were it not for these protections and the access I had to a public education, I would have never graduated with honors from a top UC and returned to my home community to help make fair housing accessible to the rural community of South Santa Clara County and Monterey County.  \n\nParticularly in regard to the various barriers we face in a small rural community not only rampant with housing issues, but transportation, planning, and funding issues alike; having access to free public schooling that makes such civil rights protections accessible: school discipline reform, language access, supports for students with disabilities, ending campus sexual violence, ending bullying and harassment, funding equity, protections for immigrants is of the upmost importance. Education is the primary passport our community members have access to in order to rise above their governments shortcomings and help create a community that is all the more benefited by these students who are able to actualize their full potential thanks to these civil rights protections that are already in place. Should these protections be altered, may it only be to add to and strengthen, not weakened or outright taken away. \nIts the Department of Educations job to help our nations schools provide high-quality education for all children. America should be a place where every child, no matter their unique challenges, their unique needs, or where they come from, can grow up to be what they dream.\n\nSincerely,\nAlyssa Kroeger\n","2261":"CITATION:  \n-CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nCOMMENT:  \n-I request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.\n\nREASONS:  \n- Including intervener services in the related services list will significantly increase the opportunities for children who are deafblind to have these services considered in their IEP process.\n- The use of interveners in educational settings continues to increase across the country.\n- Intervener services have been recognized by OSEP as a credible service delivery option for children who are deafblind under the IEP process.\n- States are hesitant to recognize the need for these services until they are recognized at a national level.\n- Due to the low incidence nature of deafblindness, the needs of these children to have a qualified intervener as part of FAPE are poorly understood.\n- Many local education agencies are not aware of what intervener services are and are hesitant to provide them.\n- Parents struggle to have these services considered in the IEP process because of the lack of awareness and understanding of their child's needs for these services.","2262":"See attachment","2263":"RE: CITATION \"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nPlease INCLUDE INTERVENER SERVICES on the list of Related Services.\n\nAs vocational rehabilitation counselor AND the parent of a blind child, I know that the use of skilled staff cannot be \nunderestimated when it comes to fostering independence and the eventual gainful contributions to society.\n\n","2264":"I imagine that by now others have asked for you to retract April 4, 2011 \"Dear Colleague\" letter pertaining to sexual violence.

I've walked the Title IX adjucation process with my son, and with other students and their families as a support after we settled our civil case with our school and accuser. Each case brings its own horrors, of injustice, innocent lives derailed and yes, sometimes destroyed.  Procedural protections that strengthen the validity of the outcomes of these cases are missing. This isn't a problem with implementation. It's a problem with ideology, biased training, how we are redefining sexual assault to such broad terms that active freely given consent can be taken away later, Student codes that require students to agree on *why* they are having sex or one is labeled a sexual predator. Students are encouraged to not call their parents, and sometimes threatened with expulsion if they talk to anyone on campus about the situation. \"Viewing times\" only for review, not allowed to record interviews or meetings, witnesses not interviewed (in our case, our son was found responsible & they had not talked to any of his witnesses. The one witness who could beyond doubt prove innocence was never interviewed, and we were told school could not require participation - discovered later school had never asked, and gag order prevented our student from asking, even though listed on witness\/hearing list), evidence denied without reason or cause, lack of support and accommodations for accused students, lack of accommodations and support to help students found not responsible get back on track. \n\nWhat is needed?

","2267":"On behalf of the Portland Community College (PCC), I write to respectfully submit the following comments re: regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification in accordance with Executive Order 13777, Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda. \n\nAs a member of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), a nonprofit association representing campus officials that serve as custodians of education records for current and former students, PCC is particularly concerned about privacy issues in general, and specifically about information security and privacy requirements of Federal and State laws.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama Administration, through the Department of Education, implemented regulatory amendments that dramatically expanded Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The amendments greatly broadened the definition of who is given access to personally identifiable information (PII) from student records on a nonconsensual basis. PCC strongly urges that the following 2012 regulatory amendments to FERPA be rescinded.\no The 2012 regulations inappropriately expanded the definition of \"Authorized Representative\" to anyone chosen by the designated official.\no We believe that the definition \"Authorized Representative\" should be restored to its previous definition of \"individuals and entities under direct control of officials\" as designated in the original statute.\nThe Term \"Implied Authority\"\no The 2012 regulations also overreached on the definition of \"Implied Authority\" to audit programs and have created much confusion, and lacks legal precedent.\no We urge the Task Force to close this loophole for non-consensual disclosure of education records.\nThe Term \"Education Program\"\no The 2012 regulations vastly widened this definition to include programs not administered by educational authorities.\no We believe that the definition of \"Education Programs\" should revert back to the original definition of \"programs administered by an educational agency or institution.\"\n\no The 2012 regulations expanded the meaning of non-consensual disclosure of personal information from education records to organization conducting \"for, or on behalf of\" educational agencies or institutions.\no We strongly urge the restoration of the limitation on the purposes for which the research exception may be invoked, and to statutorily prohibit re-disclosure of personally identifiable information by organizations accessing education records under this exception.\n\nOn August 24, 2016 the Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague Letter outlining its final guidance on the obligations of institutional school officials under FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g and the regulations in 34 C.F.R. Part 99, to protect students' education records from disclosure without consent, and provides guidance more specifically on the disclosure of student medical records.\n\nThe guidance reviewed and clarified the agency's views regarding the protections applicable to student medical records, specifically in cases where litigation occurs between the institution and the student. The letter advised colleges to handle the privacy of student medical records under FERPA similarly to the way health care providers and hospitals are required to treat such records. While [insert name of institution\/State or regional AACRAO member] favors stricter scrutiny with regards to the disclosure of student record, we are concerned that the injection of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule standards to records traditionally governed by FERPA creates unnecessary confusion for well-intentioned school officials and unintended consequences for institutions as well as students.\nWe strongly urge that the Task Force modify the Departments guidance to defer to FERPA when student medical records are involved, as previous joint guidance advises.\n\n2017 Changes to the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO)\nOn January 19, 2017, the outgoing Obama administration issued a final rule that amended FERPA to change the name of the office designated enforcement functions by the Secretary from the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) to the Office of the Chief Privacy Officer as part of an expansion of student privacy operations at the Department.\n\nHistorically, institutions have worked with the FPCO on all issues related to FERPA compliance and enforcement. The change to the name of the office, as well as its functions, is unnecessary and confusing. Moreover, the Department issued the change in the Federal Register without seeking public input. We strongly urge the Department to rescind this regulatory change and restore FPCO and its Director as the office designated to administer FERPA in all aspects.","2268":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nI request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.

Given the current requirements, it is not always clear how safety -- or students' knowledge about safety -- is enhanced.  Two examples are below:  \n\nA concern is that, for campuses in an urban\/suburban setting (i.e., not rural), the reporting on public properties adjacent to campus can be misleading, because the crimes reported often have nothing to do with university students or university life.  For consumers who see the crime statistics table of an institution as a reliable and realistic snapshot of the safety of campus, many are surprised to find that these statistics could include reportable crimes that involved individuals not related to campus in any way and do not include crimes involving students simply because of where they occur. That is, a street bordering a property close to campus that the institution owns might be the site of a robbery, but the victim and perpetrator may have no connection to the university at all.  That same robbery could involve students and take place in the front yard of a house where students live, but if the property is not owned by the institution, that robbery would not be reported. This further complicates the ability of the consumer to determine what meaning to place on the data included in the crime statistics because inclusion of statistics in the security report gives the impression that the university has a direct interest in the incident.\n","2270":"Universities' Clery Act reporting has evolved into a complicated set of requirements including varying crime hierarchies, different types of properties, and an annual report that requires over 114 unique policy statements. Given the current requirements, it is not always clear how safety -- or students' knowledge about safety -- is enhanced.  \n\nA primary concern is about student travel.  Commonly referred to as \"short stays away\", these trips range from athletic teams' travel and service trips to study abroad and student organization travel.  A university is to track all student groups' stays away of two nights or more, document the location where students stayed\/studied, and send a letter to local law enforcement there, to determine if any Clery-reportable crimes occurred in the defined reportable vicinity during a particular stay.  If reportable statistics are returned, a university is to include them in the \"non-campus property\" column of data reported to the Department of Education and included in the university's annual security report. Guidance provided by the Department of Education in its 2016 Clery Handbook states that merely sending the letter is not enough; to demonstrate due diligence, the university must now follow up to attempt to get a response (if one is not immediately forthcoming).  While some local law enforcement in the traveled-to jurisdiction respond, those responses are not always immediately helpful. Responses may be in languages other than English; foreign hotels might not even know the local force that responds, or if that local force holds the statistics.  Student groups frequently travel to locations on mission trips known to have less-than-honest law-enforcement.  By sending the letter to that law enforcement in order to remain in compliance, an institution essentially puts the local law enforcement on notice that a U.S. university is sending vulnerable students its way.  Additionally, the requested crime statistics would need to meet UCR definitions to be considered reportable.  Even many domestic jurisdictions fail to appreciate that fact when analyzing which statistics to include in the response.  This leads to more work for the institution's compliance coordinator, or the possibility of over- or under-reporting.  And with all these complications, the crime statistics for where that trip is -- if there are any such crime statistics -- have nothing to do with the safety of the actual campus.  Essentially, statistics from anywhere on the globe students travel could be potentially included in the non-campus property numbers and give the consumer the impression that these things have occurred just outside the university's \"reasonably contiguous\" on-campus property.\n","2271":"34 CFR 668.46(k)(2)(iii) is burdensome for institutions.  That regulation requires institutions' disciplinary proceedings to \"[p]rovide the accuser and the accused with the same opportunities to have others present during any institutional disciplinary proceeding, including the opportunity to be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by the advisor of their choice.\"  By permitting advisors \"of choice,\" the regulation requires institutions to allow attorneys to be support persons.  We believe this has a chilling effect on complainants, in that respondents are much more incentivized to retain attorneys.  The consequence is that a complainant can be met with a proceeding of many surprising twists and turns, where the accused, with counsel by his or her side, is engaged in legal maneuverings to circumvent the disciplinary system.  In other words, the complainant's expectation of a fair proceeding will be unmet.  And on a college campus, word travels fast.  The message will soon become, \"You better not bring a Title IX complaint because the accused might have an attorney, and if you can't afford to have one, then you'll lose.\"  In short, victims of sexual misconduct - often already reluctant to come forward -  may become completely incapable if they do not have the resources for an attorney.  \n\nThe additional concern with this regulation is that it turns disciplinary proceedings into quasi-legal proceedings.  This detracts from the educational role such proceedings were meant to have for students, i.e., the educational objectives of promoting candor; fairness; understanding consequences; curbing future problematic behavior; restoration and healing.  The presence of attorneys strips the proceedings of all informality and unduly intensifies them, and students are deprived the opportunity of dealing with their issues in an informal, non-litigious setting, where they can learn from mistakes and learn how to better deal with life.  \n","2272":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nI request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.\n\nAs a practicing school psychologist, trainer of school psychologists, and as a professional who has spent the last 12 years researching and assisting families of children and youth who are deafblind, I cannot think of a better modification to the regulations than to include Intervener Services.

Certification programs already exist to support the development of interveners to ensure qualified professionals are available.  An intervener assists the student who presents with a combined vision and hearing loss to their unique ways of learning in the educational setting.  They provide access to instruction happening in the classroom by the primary teacher (which may otherwise be missed or not accessible), access to social relationships and gains in adaptive behavior and access to information in their environment that allows for incidental learning.  Much of our learning occurs outside of the general instruction and through interactions throughout the school day.  Having access to this plethora of information in our everyday environments can make significant gains in academic, social, adaptive, and behavioral skills, resulting in students who graduate with accessibility to employment and contributing members of society.  \n","2273":"Please revise regulations and \"guidance\" to reflect fair and equitable treatment for all students.","2274":"Sexual assault is a pervasive, and extremely daunting problem on our nation's college campuses.

In order to provide FAPE for children with deafblindess, a broader understanding and recognition of the role of the intervener is crucial. These children deserve to have appropriately trained individuals working with them. Those trained individuals deserve to be recognized for their additional education. It is a disservice to this population of children to not have interveners as an option, and as many of these children cannot speak, we will have to be their voice to bring attention to this matter. ","2284":"The Department of Education should make it a priority to rescind the disastorous April 4, 2011 \"Dear Colleague\" letter, requiring colleges receiving federal funds to minimze due process protections for students (almost all male) accused of sexual assault, and to use the preponderance of the evidence standard for determining responsibility. Determination of sexual assault claims do not belong in academia - determining whether the abominable crime of sexual assault has been committed, belongs with the criminal justice system. While colleges should retain the ability to separate an accuser and accused on campus, they should not be able to expel or sanction an accused student absent a criminal conviction. \n\nThe reasoning DOE gave for the preponderance of the evidence requirement - that it is the standard for civil cases - was specious. In the civil justice system, a defendant has the full range of discovery, and due process rights at trial. If colleges must remain in the business of adjudicating claims of sexual assault, they should be required to do the following: (1) notify criminal authorities of the complaint; (2) notify the respondent of the specifics of the charge early in the process; \n(3) provide the respondent with the identity of all witnesses, and copies of all relevant documents; (4) disclose exculpatory evidence to the respondent; (5) allow for active attorney participation in the hearing process; (6) allow for direct cross-examination of adverse witnesses; (7) require use of the  \"clear and convincing\" evidentiary standard. \n\nWhile Ms. Candice Jackson's comments about drunken sex with later regrets, may have been spoken too casually, she was in fact correct that too often alcohol-fueled sex with later regret by the accuser, does account for a not insignificant number of sexual assault accusations. The goal of reducing sexual assaults on campus must not be pursued by enabling a shadow \"justice\" system in which the notion of burden of proof for the accuser or institution is given lip service, and in which due process protections for the accused, which are at the core of our nation's institutions, are discarded. \n\nRequiring fairness for an accused male student is neither unfair to a female accuser, nor does it indicate sympathy with rapists and sexual predators. Mandating fairness for both the accuser and the accused merely reflects our country's core values that no individual should have their reputation tainted and be severely punished, by a private or public institution, without a fair process to determine their guilt or innocence of wrongdoing. For public colleges, in my opinion, the Constitution demands greater protection for the accused than suggested by the Department in the April 4, 2011 \"Dear Colleague\" letter.\n\nI am an attorney who represents college students in disciplinary proceedings, and have represented a number of male accused, who I believed were innocent of wrong doing, in Title IX proceedings precipitated by claims of sexual assault made against them.

","2285":"My comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Specifically, these regulations identify jobs within the congressionally-mandated AbilityOne program as not competitive integrated employment. These regulations are in direct opposition to the purpose of the AbilityOne program which provides certain federal contracts, oftentimes on military installations, to nonprofit organizations that agree to have the majority of the work performed by individuals with disabilities. The entire purpose of the AbilityOne program is to ensure that individuals with disabilities have competitive employment opportunities. Unfortunately, the regulations identified above have caused vocational rehabilitation services in my state (New Jersey) and 18 other states to stop referring individuals with disabilities to these jobs where they earn high wages and benefits. This is having a significant negative impact on individuals with disabilities who are being boxed out of excellent employment opportunities as well as the ability of nonprofit organizations to employ the number of people with disabilities required by their participation in the AbilityOne program. Most concerning of all, the regulations remove choice from people with disabilities by assuming they are not able to select the work setting that best suits them. \n\nAs the Executive Director of a nonprofit organization providing vocational services to 400+ individuals with disabilities, I can attest that these regulations are eliminating job opportunities for individuals with significant disabilities who deserve the opportunity to work. The language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice, and technical guidance. Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased, employment opportunities at my agency are going unfilled. Deserving individuals with significant disabilities are denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our community.  \n\nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation.\n","2286":"Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,\n\nI am an attorney who has represented over the past 4 years more than 100 students, mostly male, in Title IX college disciplinary proceedings and related litigation in the wake of such proceedings.

They need to be prosecute in the criminal justice system, and if convicted sent to Prison. If it is not a case of actual sexual assault, but an instance of 2 drunk college students having sex, why are we quick to assume that the young man is  guilty of sexual assault?   were they not both impaired, making neither capable of consent?\n \n Why use a preponderance standard when so much is at  risk?  Do we not want to make sure of guilt before labeling someone a \"rapist\" with no due process, cross examination rights. It is not ok to ruin someones life because someone decides months later that they were assaulted.  We are sending the wrong messages to our colleges students both male and female, when we tell them they are not responsible because They made the decision to drink to much.  \n\nLet the police handle these types of serious crimes.  Schools dont handle murders or assaults on Campus.  If schools are going to handle these, appoint counsel to both sides, allow cross examination  Give the parties the option of taking a polygraph .  Raise the standard of proof  to clear and convincing evidence. Give each side the due process rights they should have.  Taking away an educational opportunity earned should not be done lightly.   There are 2 sides to most stories.

These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious, job-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance. My states vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency is one of at least 19 states VR that have stopped referring and placing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program. \nVocational Guidance Services is an NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and creates 165 of jobs. Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased employment opportunities at my agency are going un-filled. Deserving individuals with significant disabilities are denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our community.  \nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation.\nSincerely,\nRobert E.

Didlake is a non-profit community rehabilitation program (CRP) which, on an annual basis, supports over 2,000 people who have a wide range of disabilities for which they  require employment and ancillary supports. Didlake participates in the AbilityOne Program (A1), the largest source of employment in the United States for individuals who are blind or have significant disabilities, in order to generate quality employment opportunities to enable the individuals we support to become gainfully employed.\n\nThe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), signed into law in 2014 with bipartisan support, was intended to support individuals with disabilities to obtain competitive integrated employment. Subsequent to its passage, the US Department Of Education\/Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) began promulgating guidance concerning the implementation of WIOA. That guidance included a \"re-definition\" of competitive integrated employment that was not a part of the WIOA law, nor did it reflect the intent of Congress. Unfortunately, the guidance promulgated by RSA resulted in the polar opposite of what it was intended to do. It has taken away the opportunity for a vast number of individuals with significant disabilities, who expressed an interest in becoming employed in A1 and demonstrated a need to receive employment supports from a CRP sponsored by state Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies to gain and\/or sustain employment.\n\nCollateral damage was inflicted by the re-definition of competitive integrated employment when it erroneously singled out A1, and its participating CRPs, by disqualifying them as competitive integrated employment settings simply for no apparent reason other than their self-proclaimed guidance. There was nothing the CRPs had done to provoke such a redefinition. The employment settings available by virtue of A1 are among the most diverse and community integrated settings in the country that include installations within all branches of the military and virtually every department and agency of the Federal government, pay full prevailing wages and benefits with significant promotional and outplacement opportunities for all. \n\nUnfortunately, widespread confusion occurred among state VR agencies all across the country because the decades long relationship between VR and A1 was put into limbo as a result of the baffling guidance issued by RSA which surfaced without adequate explanation. Proof of that is the fact that many VR agencies stopped referring individuals for A1 employment while others continued to do so using their own interpretations of the guidance issued by RSA.  In fact, since the re- definition became effective in September 2016, 20 state VRs are no longer making referrals for employment to A1 while referrals have slowed in virtually all other states. This has taken a devastating toll on individuals with significant disabilities who simply want employment with CRPs participating in A1 and need the support of VR. \n\nWe at Didlake appreciate this Administration's good sense approach to identifying and removing job- stifling regulations. While generally supporting the regulations contained in ED-2015-OSERS-001-1167, we profoundly  disagree with the RSA regulatory re-definition of Competitive Integrated Employment because it restricts access to quality competitive, integrated jobs for people with significant disabilities; it is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, longstanding practice and technical guidance; it limits the ability of state VR counselors to best determine the needs and competitive job fit for their individual clients with significant disabilities; and it discriminates against non-profit employers of people with significant disabilities. Therefore, it must be revised!\n\nI would be pleased to speak more with the members of the Task Force, if I can be of further assistance.

Regulations issued by the Department of Education are creating a negative impact for people who are blind across the country.\n\nNumber 1: The Department's interpretation of \"Competitive Integrated Employment\" is denying individuals who are blind opportunities for good jobs and upwardly mobile career path.  Language included in the preamble of the WIOA final rule identifies job opportunities in an AbilityOne affiliated organization are not deemed to meet the definition of competitive integrated employment.  As a result, no job opportunities at a non-profit organization holding an AbilityOne or state use contract qualify as a successful employment outcome, resulting in denial of individuals to receive additional services through state vocational rehabilitation programs.  This denies individuals who are blind the opportunity to gain self-sufficiency and independence by closing the door to work that pays solid wages, offers good benefits and has a pathway to upward mobility and career development.  Merely because of association with AbilityOne, jobs within our agency are deemed not real jobs because they are not \"typically found in the community\".  NewView provides a work environment typically found in the community, providing high skilled manufacturing jobs, administrative positions, professional positions, call center jobs and many more.  We offer full time employment with pay well above minimum wage, full benefit package including paid health insurance and retirement benefits.  Conversely, the Department of Education\/RSA considers part-time work with undetermined work hours, at minimum wage with no benefits to be considered integrated competitive employment and will favor these outcomes over positions offered through NewView Oklahoma and agencies like ours across the country.  This decision is arbitrary and counterproductive in promoting self-sufficiency and economic independence.  \n\nOur agency does not endorse the payment of sub-minimum wage nor are we a sheltered work shop.  We offer full wage and benefit eligible positions that are not considered acceptable employment options for our resident's who are blind because the job is within an organization who employs a high percentage of individuals who have vision impairments.  We have numerous individuals working at our agency now that literally sat at home for years receiving services from vocational rehabilitation with no employment prospects until they found NewView.  No one should be denied the opportunity to work or receive services by the mere fact they work next to someone with a disability.  I urge you to seek an amendment to the rules that eliminates any bias against the employer, including those non-profit agencies holding AbilityOne or state use contracts and instead weigh the value of the employment on the critical values determined in the statute including compensation, benefits, opportunities for career advancement and informed choice.  Where a person works and who they work with should not in and of itself be a disqualifying factor for a successful employment outcome and access to services.\n\nNumber 2:  We are asking that the Homemaker Outcome (uncompensated outcome) be reinstated as this rule ignores the vital role this exemption has for individuals who are blind.  Prior to the WIOA final rules, individuals who are blind could qualify for vocational rehabilitation services including services for independent living as homemakers.  Eliminating this outcome was purely discretionary and problematic as this decision disproportionately impacts people who are blind.  As one gentleman once told me, \"You have to live to work\".  The United States government has defined blindness as a catastrophic disability.  The adjustment to blindness is neither easy nor rapid and in many instances, an individual cannot imagine how they are going to live with blindness and certainly cannot imagine how they would work.  In addition, vision rehabilitation is not covered under insurance so without access to services through the vocational rehabilitation system, there is no question that a person cannot effectively find work.  Thus, we are asking for an immediate reinstatement of the Homemaker Outcome.

I understand that prosecuting rapists can be difficult.  Often there is little evidence and cases can come down to he said\/she said.  But this is no excuse for throwing away basic principles of our legal system in order to punish suspects.  The current procedures dealing with suspected rapists in colleges built on the 12\/2011 Dear Colleague Letter have severely reduced due process for suspects.  At the threat of losing their federal funding colleges must now virtually find all suspects guilty and expel them, ruining their college careers and lives.  \n\nThis has resulted in much judicial conflict.  Men who feel they have been treated unfairly are suing their schools, and many have been successful.  There have been at least 170 of these lawsuits recently.    \n\nMuch of this has been the result of a bogus rape hysteria in colleges.  Biased and poorly designed studies have promoted the ridiculous statistic that 20% of college women are raped or sexually assaulted.  Activists have used this and other statistics to demand that colleges shun the criminal justice system and punish college men with little more than an accusation.  College disciplinary boards are designed to punish plagiarism and cheating on tests, not rape, which should be handled by our courts.  Once the courts have convicted a rapist, then colleges are justified in expelling them.  \n\nAnother statistic used by activists is that only 2% of rapes are false.  This implies that virtually all accusations are true and should be believed, resulting in a suspect being \"guilty until proven innocent.\"  There is no scholarly research justifying this statistic.  It appeared in Against Our Will by Susan Brownmiller and spread like wildfire.  Though actual research on this subject is inconclusive, the real rate of false accusations of rape appears to be much higher.  A peer-reviewed study by Eugene Kanin found a rate of 41%.  A study in Ottawa, Canada, found a rate of 31%.  The Rape Crisis Cell of the Delhi Commission for Women found a 53% rate of false accusations.  And DNA testing by the FBI has consistently excluded about 25% of sexual assault suspects.  \n\nRecent high profile cases also show that false accusations may be common.  Examples include the New York City jogger case, the Duke lacrosse team, the University of Virginia fraternity falsely convicted in Rolling Stone, the Nikki Yovino case, Andrea Pino's accusation in the movie The Hunting Ground, Lena Dunham's retroactive accusation in her book Not That Kind of Girl, and two immigrants accused of raping a classmate in a Rockville, Maryland, high school bathroom.  Could false rape accusations really be rare if so many high profile cases are false?  It appears that rape has a very high rate of false accusation, and suspects should be considered innocent until proven guilty and given every due process protection.\n\nThe use of Title IX to justify colleges' current involvement in rape cases is quite a stretch.  Title IX says that schools cannot discriminate on the basis of sex if the schools receive federal assistance.  Feminists have theorized that rape infringes on a woman's right to an equal educational opportunity.  As Zoe Heller as put it, \"This is rather like having a group of train conductors prosecute the rape of a female commuter, on the basis that the crime violates her equal right to use public transport.\"  And why is this theory only used to protect women?  If a male college student is attacked and severely injured to the point of not being able to take advantage of his equal educational opportunity, couldn't he forego any criminal process and demand that the school punish his attacker?  Why does Title IX only apply to women?  Title IX's application appears to be quite sexist.  \n\nIf all of this isn't bad enough, colleges are now adding affirmative consent into the mix.  Initiators of sex, i.e. men, must now receive a clear \"yes\" from women before every sexual activity.  This is just not practical.  Basically, it opens up all college men to accusations of rape and infantilizes women.\n\nThe current sexual assault processes employed by colleges should be stopped.  These processes have been used to bypass criminal justice safeguards in order to punish men accused of sexual assault.  These cases should be handled by the criminal justice system, not colleges, which are not prepared to handle them.  \n\n","2442":"In regard to: CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Service, I request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.

I would like to suggest modifications to two existing regulations that pertain to transfer students.  For standard term and non standard term SE9W programs, the existing process works fine.  However, for students enrolling in clock hour, credit hour nonterm, or nonstandard terms programs that are not SE9W, the process is very complicated.  I would like to recommend simplifying this process. \n \n1)Regulation 685.301(a)(10(ii) provides the minimum loan period permitted for students who transfer from another school and the previous school originated a loan that overlaps the enrollment period at the new school.  Schools are permitted to originate a loan to cover the remainder of the previous school's academic year.  The other option is that the new school may award a loan for the new school's academic year.  For either option, you may not award more than the remaining balance of the annual loan limit.  \n\nUsing the first option and awarding a loan for the remainder of the previous school's academic year causes a number of complications.  The loan period at the new school may not align with the payment periods at the new school.  This is also results in subsequent loan periods not aligning with payment periods at the new school.  In addition, this impacts the Return to Title IV funds if a student awarded under this option decides to withdraw.  There has been very little guidance on the Return to Title IV process for students in this situation.  I've submitted questions to ED which have gone to policy and I have waited for over one year for answers.  This leads me to believe that even policy realizes the complications associated with this situation.  If it was an easier process, I'm certain they would have already provided answers.    \n\nI believe that some schools are using the 2nd option and just awarding for a full academic year for the remainder of the annual limit.  This option is certainly an easier option, but doesn't allow the student to receive the full amount they are entitled to receive.  \n\nI would like to suggest an additional option available to schools for students in these situations.  My recommendation is to allow these schools to use their payment periods for awarding loans.  If the previous school's academic year ends during the new school's first payment period of the academic year, allow the school to award the remainder of the annual limit for that first payment period.  The student would then be eligible for a new academic year and annual loan limit beginning with the 2nd payment period.  If the loan ends in the middle of the 2nd payment period of the academic year, the new school can award the loan for a full academic year for the remainder of the annual limit.  This will allow the loans to align with the new school's payment periods and eliminate the complicated process associated with the Return to Title IV funds.  This also simplifies the cost of attendance calculation for these abbreviated loans.\n\n2)Regulation 668.4(g)(3)(iii) deals with students who transfer to a new program at the same school.  This regulation provides that the student can be treated as if they are in the same payment period if the credit\/clock hours and weeks are substantially equal in length.  This causes issues with students who transfer between day and evening versions of the same program.  The coursework is the same and the credential awarded is the same.  However, evening students will normally progress at a slower pace than the day students.  This causes the weeks to be different for their payment periods and therefore, they can't be considered as being in the same payment period.  This student must be withdrawn from the original program and the Return to Title IV calculation must be performed.  The student is then awarded funds in the new program as a transfer student to a new program. \n\nIf the coursework is exactly the same and only the weeks change, why not treat the student as being in the same payment period?  The academic year and loan period can be extended and the dates for future disbursements can be adjusted.  This would be a much simpler process for students in these situations.    \n\nThank you again for allowing interested parties to suggest changes.\n\n","2445":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Service\nI request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services. \nIncluding intervener services in the related services list will significantly increase the opportunities for children who are deafblind to have these services considered in their IEP process.

Today, male students are expelled after a drunk hook-up, even when the boy is also drinking and even when the boy had NOTHING to do with the girl getting drunk. She can do anything and everything IN PUBLIC to indicate that she is interested in hooking up (read the cases, I do not want to be explicit), yet she can wake up and decide she regrets having slept with the boy, and because Title IX advocates tell her that regret equals rape, she proceeds to ruin a boys life. Why is it the case that she is not responsible for her own actions? Why isn't she also expelled since the boy was also drinking? How does the issue change if its two girls: are they both expelled because neither can be held to have consented or are neither expelled because Title IX de facto only punishes boys? Has a female ever been expelled for a false accusation (we know they exist, read the papers)?\n\nIn addition to the need for due process and rules requiring impartiality at very step and in every structure of the prosecution, Title IX needs to be reformed to only allow expulsion and transcript marking when there are aggravating circumstances:  evidence of force, evidence of drugging a girl, or similar items. \n\nAn accused student should also be able to challenge the accuser's motivations in accusing. If a girl threatens to kill a boy or ruin his life if they break-up, why isn't the accused student allowed to cross examine and challenge her testimony when she accuses him weeks or months later?\n\nHow can a system not be discriminatory when it assumes girls don't lie, but boys do, when it only prosecutes males, and when it assumes that it is acceptable for an adult female to ruin a boy's life but not assume that the same adult female can be responsible for her own drinking? And how can any system be fair when the threat of federal de-funding means that it is in the college's interest to prosecute a boy rather than be fair? \n\nChange the rules to include due process, the presumption of innocence, add an aggravating factor test, and allow an accused student to cross examine his accuser. Change the de-funding rule to remove federal funding if a college is shown to be biased, to not follow the rules, or if a college fails in its duty to treat all students fairly.\n\n","2458":"I request modification by adding Intervener to to the list CFR Services TITLE 34Subtitle 111Chapter11 Part 300 Subpart A paragraph 300.34 related services because my granddaughter has benefited greatly from INTERVENERS","2459":"RE: CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\n\nI request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.\nAs a parent of an 18 year old deaf blind girl, we have faced many challenges throughout her schooling years to get\nthe proper supports in place to advance her education.

It is a parents comfort knowing that their child is being exchanged from their hands into the hands of a qualified, educated intervener's hands to be cared for, educated in a way that is best suited towards their individual child and someone that will love their child for who they are.  The scariest experience for a parent is letting that child go that already has disadvantages against them without being able to see and hear.  Interveners develop a one on one trusting bond with these children.  The child feels safe and secure.  At the child's worst moments,the intervener usually knows what the child needs and at best can figure it out because they know that child so well.  My student is non-verbal, he didn't pick anyone means of communication to use.  This caused a great deal of frustration and stress on the student.  I was bound and determined to find a way that he would feel comfortable using with myself and others to communicate,in which to at least answer yes and no questions.  I went back and watched Helen Keller.  Back to the bare basics.  Inspired by this movie, I began to teach the student to hold one fist to his cheek or to mine to indicate \"yes\" and both fists (one on each cheek) to communicate \"no\".  Within a week the student learned this way of communicating.  He used it with the special service people that came in and at home as well.  He could now make choices and have his voice heard.  Huge break through and less frustration and aggression on the students part.\n\nHowever during the summer break the school district didn't want to spend the money on the intervener to do ESY with the student, which in the past was allowed.  He only got to see the general special ED teacher once a week.  Her focus was to read with the student and A,B training but didn't include the back and forth dialect.  The skill of using his mode of communication for \"yes & no\" was not enforced and at home the parents weren't using it.  So the student, lost his mode of communication because it wasn't being used.  If an Intervener was working with the student through the summer his communication mode would have continued if not exceeded and communication with parents and proper encouragement with the importance to continue the communication at home.  Not only the communication failing but the relationship between intervener and student was compromised due to 3 months of not working together.  The student seemed mad at me when school started.  He was aggressive and didn't want to be near anyone.  I had to re establish my relationship with him and\nIt took weeks.  The communication mode came back to him fairly quickly.  When asked if he was mad at me for not seeing me over the summer, he immediately put 1 hand to his cheek to indicate \"Yes\".  The weeks it took dealing with his anger could have been used to educate him to reach another goal!  Interveners to these students is the next best thing to their families.  Where do we feel safest, at home with our family.  They should feel the same comfort while learning in a school system as the regular student that hears and speaks for themselves do.

But in its new regulations, the DOE eliminated the Homemaker\nOutcome. For working age adults who lose their vision through disease or trauma, the adjustment to blindness is neither easy nor rapid and often requires\nsubstantial rehabilitation before a person can think about pursuing employment. Before a person who loses sight can consider returning to work, they must\nfirst learn to read using braille or access technology. They must learn to live independently, which involves learning to cook and clean and manage their\nhomes without sight. People who are blind must study orientation and mobility in order to navigate safely in their surroundings. This rehabilitation is\nnot supported by insurance. Thus, Americans who are blind, like single mothers and college students, rely chiefly on state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies,\nfunded by the Department of Education, to regain their independence. Eliminating Homemakers as qualifying for Vocational Rehabilitation services cuts\noff many people from these badly needed services. Across the United States, more than 10% of all VR case files involving the newly blind were Homemakers.\n\nThe DOE should reinstate the Homemaker Outcome immediately. \nA new definition of Competitive Integrated Employment is denying individuals with visual disabilities full access to good jobs and upwardly mobile career\nopportunities. \nThe WIOA regulations exclude jobs in a nonprofit organization that has an AbilityOne contract, regardless of the position, because they are not considered\nto be competitive and integrated and therefore do not qualify as appropriate job placements. This means that the job seeker who wants one of those jobs\nwill not receive eligible rehabilitation services such as mobility training and adaptive technology. AbilityOne is the preeminent federal program that\nprovides sustainable jobs for people with disabilities. Nearly 50,000 Americans with disabilities, including more than 3,000 veterans, are employed through\nthis program across the country. With a nearly 70% unemployment rate, disqualifying these jobs is misguided. Amazingly, the DOE does regard part-time\njobs with undetermined work hours, at minimum wage without benefits in restaurants or retail outlets to be competitive integrated positions and will favor\nthem over the above positions, when faced with a choice. Many blind Missourians have been discouraged from taking full-time, benefit-eligible jobs at\nAbilityOne agencies because of these new regulations and, thus, remain unemployed. It is absurd. \nThis not only sends a negative message to individuals employed through AbilityOne, it denies job seekers who are blind the opportunity to gain self-sufficiency\nand independence by closing the door to work that pays solid wages, offers good benefits, and has a career path. \nOver 40 Members of Congress, including area representatives Lynn Jenkins, Ron Estes, Vickie Hartzler and Jason Smith, recently wrote a letter to the DOE\nurging it to amend these regulations. \nWe believe the Department should heed their advice and support AbilityOne jobs that offer excellent compensation, benefits and opportunities for career\nadvancement. \nBy making these common-sense changes to Department of Education regulations, people who are blind will have the best opportunity to live independently\nand prosper in society.

We ask the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, to direct the Administration and the Department of Education to right this wrong.\n\nYour constituents who are visually impaired deserve better than the fate WIOA has bestowed upon them.

It must be a lonely place where no one bothers to learn your language, least of all the teachers. ","2471":"Although I am writing today in my capacity as an individual citizen, I have spent the last quarter-century studying, working in, and teaching in institutions of higher education. I began my graduate studies as the Clery Act was passed and have made countless presentations at the state, regional, and national level on the topic over the past 25 years. \n\nCongress passed the Clery Act in 1990 and has amended the law at least 5 times since then (1992, 1998, 2000, 2008, and 2015). Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Education has overseen publication of 3 editions of the Clery Act Handbook (2005, 2011, and 2016).\n\nThe statute requires that institutions of higher education report crime statistics for \"the occurrence on campus, in or on noncampus buildings or property, and on public property.\" Over time, the definition of noncampus buildings or property has expanded to the point that the statistics provided are effectively meaningless. \n\nThe current regulations define noncampus building or property in the following terms:\n\nNoncampus building or property. (i)\nAny building or property owned or\ncontrolled by a student organization that\nis officially recognized by the\ninstitution; or\n(ii) Any building or property owned\nor controlled by an institution that is\nused in direct support of, or in relation\nto, the institutions educational\npurposes, is frequently used by\nstudents, and is not within the same\nreasonably contiguous geographic area\nof the institution. \n\nI am particularly concerned about Part ii of the definition. Consider these examples from the 2016 Clery Act Handbook:\n\nRepeated use of a location for school-sponsored\ntrips: If your institution sponsors students on an\novernight trip every year and the students stay in the\nsame hotel each year, you must include portions of\nthe hotel in your noncampus geography. For\nexample, students in the debate club take a trip to\nWashington, D.C. and stay at the same hotel every\nyear. You must include in your statistics any crimes\nthat occur in the rooms used by your students and any\ncommon areas used to access the rooms (lobby,\nelevators, etc.) for the times and dates specified in the\nrental agreement. Note that what matters here is\nrepeated use of a location that is owned or controlled\nby the institution, not the number of days it is used or\nwhether it is used by the same students or different\nstudents. \n\nWhen an institution rents a hotel for two nights for a student trip, this is now considered noncampus building or property.\n\nInstitutions spend countless hours tracking down crime statistics for properties under their control only fleetingly just to grouped together with countless other similar brief uses. The noncampus building and property crime statistics are meaningless, even for those who fully understand the sources of the data.  I urge the U.S. Department of Education to take a more pragmatic and commonsense approach to operationalizing Part ii of the definition of noncampus building or property.","2472":"Office of the Secretary, Department of Education\nDocket #: ED-2017-OS-0047\n\nMy name is Michael Chew and I am the Executive Director of Mississippi Industries for the Blind in Jackson, MS.  But more importantly, I am an individual who is totally blind.  And as a person who is blind, the final regulations by the Department of Education on WIOA cause me great concern for other individuals who are blind or who will become blind in the future.\n\nI lost my sight after age 40, and from this experience I can confidently say that this transition period is a difficult one.  I was helped by receiving services from the local Department of Rehabilitation.  \n\nMy two major concerns regarding the WIOA VR rule are:  (1) The emphatic statements that pre-judge the Ability One Program and have resulted in several state VR agencies no longer working with Ability One nonprofit agencies, with a resultant loss of placements or even referrals from VR; and (2) The decision by the Education Department in this rule to eliminate (phase out) the uncompensated outcomes category, which includes the Homemaker Exemption.  \n\nFirst, let me speak to the harmful comments regarding the Ability One program.  These comments were inserted into the DOE regulations and are not part of the legislation passed by Congress.  And in fact, the regulations are contradictory.  In part of the regulations they state that Ability One jobs are not to be considered as a successful closure without any evaluation of the job at all.  Later in the same regulations, it states that Rehab agencies and providers must evaluate each job on its own merit.  The Department of Education should clarify this position and provide the guidance to the state Rehab organizations that all jobs must be evaluated on their own merit.  \n\nPeople who are blind are already being negatively affected by the statements against the Ability One program.  MIB is currently recruiting individuals who are blind for a number of positions in California for a project we have with the Navy.  These jobs will be located in a naval office building.  These individuals will be working alongside many sighted individuals.  All of these jobs fall under the Service Contract Act and are great paying jobs with the associated health and welfare benefits required by the program.   These jobs meet all of the integrated and competitive requirements.  However, MIB is not receiving referrals from Vocational Rehab for these jobs. This is one example of how the WIOA regulations are harming individuals who are blind by limiting their choice of where they want to work.\n\nAny regulations of this type should not limit a person's right to choose where they want to work.  The individual should be able to choose the company and employment setting they want to work in.   \n\nNext regarding the phase out of the Uncompensated Outcomes, including the Homemaker exemption, is an item that should be removed from the final regulations.   This now cuts off opportunities for people who experience vision loss later in life to receive training and supports that could lead to their reentry into the workforce after regaining confidence and the skills necessary to return to work.   This category is used by more individuals who are blind than any other disability.\n\nThere are many skills that must be learned when someone loses their sight.   From my own experience, it takes a lot of adjustment in one's personal life to make this transition.  And a person will not have the confidence to consider reentry in to the workforce until these skills are mastered.  Without the Uncompensated Outcomes category, where will people who have recently lost their sight be able to receive training in these personal skills?   \n\nAgain, the legislation passed by congress did not specify that these outcomes be phased out.  This was a decision made by the Department of Education.  Therefore, the Department has the ability to reverse this phase out and allow people who are blind to receive the training necessary to live a more normal, independent life.\n\nIn summary, it is my recommendation that the Department of Education does the following in regards to the WIOA regulations:\n\n1.Remove the negative and harmful statements regarding the Ability One program and issue written guidance to all state Rehabilitation agencies to evaluate all jobs on their own merit regardless of their location or the organization providing the employment opportunity.  By doing this, each state will be consistent in the application of the WIOA rules.\n2.Eliminate the phase out of the uncompensated Outcome rule, including the Homemaker Exemption, so that individuals may receive the training necessary for daily living.\n \nBy implementing these 2 recommendations, people who are blind will not be unfairly and negatively affected by the WIOA regulations.   \n\nMichael Chew\nExecutive Director\nMississippi Industries for the Blind\nJackson, MS\n\n","2473":"The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence is writing in support of the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter clarifying Title IX's intended purpose of protecting all students from sexual violence and harassment. In addition, we support the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) correct clarification that the evidentiary standard in campus disciplinary hearings is preponderance of the evidence.\n \nThe results of the NH Violence Against Women Survey concluded that nearly one in four women in New Hampshire has been sexually assaulted. Forty one percent of the most recent sexual assaults reported in the New Hampshire survey occurred before the victim's 18th birthday, and 83% occurred before the age of 25. The issuance of the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter was in response to the clear need to prevent and respond to sexual assault on campuses.

This is critically important because poor and working class students of color are disproportionately impacted by harsh discipline, low numbers of counseling staff and an absence of college preparation curricula and college readiness resources. Tracking data is an important mechanism for ensuring that our most underserved and under-resourced school-communities are provided with the tools they need to give students of color a shot at educational equity.  For example, in many schools in the Los Angeles School District, students struggle to gain access to college counselors, college prep classes (especially AP and Honors classes) as well as tutoring and quality after school programming.  These resources are in abundant supply in the more affluent schools in the LAUSD which are predominantly white and Asian.  Heavy school and community police presence and surveillance equipment make many of these campuses unwelcoming environments to students who already encounter prison-like conditions in their communities.  These conditions have a strongly negative impact on the psyches and emotional wellness of our youth, who already face steep barriers to college-admission.","2475":"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\nI request modification to the regulations to add intervener services  for students who are  deafblind on the list of related services \nThrough my work as a teacher of the Deaf, I have encountered several deafblind students (about a dozen in 10 years) only one of whom had an intervener.

","2476":"I am a student at Rutgers University- a university where approximately 20% of undergraduate females and 5% of undergraduate males experience some form of unwanted sexual contact during their time here as an undergraduate student. At Rutgers, students who do not identify as heterosexual are 2x to 3x more likely to experience sexual violence both before coming to college and during their time as an undergraduate. However, despite these high numbers of sexual assaults, few are ever even reported- and fewer survivors are ever served justice. 77% of survivors who ever confide in someone about their assault only confide in a close friend. In order to end sexual violence and end the stigmas that keep students suffering in silence, it is vital that universities are well-equipped to properly handle such situations as they arise, citizens are well-educated and informed about these topics, and survivors are provided with the proper and necessary resources. This includes Title IX offices, which have been revolutionary in helping combat sexual violence on campus. When students suffer sexual assault and harassment, they are deprived of equal and free access to an education.  Title IX offices ensure that students are protected from sexual violence and gender-based violence. Together, we can ensure that sexual violence becomes a thing of the past in our nation. However, the way to achieve this is not by rolling back Title IX guidelines - that will only make sexual violence on college campuses worse. It is important to remember that a culture has long existed, and still exists, that prevents many survivors from ever speaking out about what has happened to them. Stripping the few resources that exist to help those who have undergone such a violating and traumatic experience is cruel, inhumane, and bad policy. Furthermore, it should be noted that the percentage of students who are wrongly accused of rape is incredibly low-an estimated 2%. Decisions should be made with the the far larger number of those who are honest about their experiences-and brave enough to come forward- in mind. \n","2477":"Title IX exists to protect against discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity, including protection against sexual harassment and assault.

I also add additional comments. \n\nThe gist of my comment is that the documents call for a complainant-friendly process of investigation and adjudication that is at odds with the requirements for an impartial and equitable process. \n\nPoint 1: Universities are highly unlikely to be fair to the accused student (typically male) given the current climate on campuses (\"women do not lie about rape\") and given that universities have overriding interests in protecting their public image, which affects enrollment and donations. As recent history has shown, accused rapists become instant pariahs and are not often afforded a presumption of innocence, and universities are all too often predisposed to find the accused responsible. Simply put, the guidance documents as written were abysmally naive to assume that universities would provide for impartial processes. They may act to provide what superficially seem to be impartial processes, but that has not been the result. \n\nPoint 2: The strong discouragement of cross-examination by either party has been taken as a prohibition of cross-examination by representatives of the parties. The apparent justification of this is the potential for further \"trauma\" to be felt by the accuser (e.g., see F7 of 2014 document). This is justification is based on the dubious belief that wrongful allegations are rare. Nowhere is there evidence that this is true in college adjudication processes. \n\nThe dubious belief I'm referring to is based on the oft-repeated statistic that only 2 to 8% of sexual assault accusations are false. The primary problem is that the statistic almost surely does not apply to campus adjudications today, where, according to some recently available data, the rate of wrongful accusations may be closer to 50 or 60%.\n\nColleges do not typically report outcomes for their adjudications of campus sexual assault cases. But there have been two illuminating exceptions in the past few months as this issue has heated up. The first comes from NCHERM (National Center for Higher Education Risk Management), the primary group that advises and contracts with hundreds of colleges to protect the colleges from legal difficulties involving Title IX sexual harassment cases. NCHERM published a white paper this year stating that they are getting reports from colleges that 60% of accused students in sexual assault cases are being found \"not responsible,\" the equivalent of not guilty (page 15). Here's the link to the NCHERM report: https:\/\/www.ncherm.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/TNG-Whitepaper-Final-Electronic-Version.pdf . It is worth noting that NCHERM is financially dependent on the continuation of college adjudications of sexual assault charges, hence their admission of this high rate is significant.\n\nThe second source of outcome data comes from Stanford University. Stanford's provost reported outcome data on May 31: 24% of allegations in the prior 15 months of a new policy were thrown out as invalid before getting to the investigation stage, and 50% of accused students tried in subsequent hearings were found \"not responsible\". Under the preponderance standard, that is equivalent to saying the accused were likely to be innocent.  In other words, over half of the accusations were false, unfounded, or just too dubious to be investigated or to receive a decision of \"responsible.\" Here's the link to the Provost's statement: http:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2017\/05\/31\/progress-report-student-title-ix-process\/ \n\nFor both the NCHERM and Stanford reports, the results are under 2011 Dear Colleague Letter directives that discourage cross examination and active participation by an attorney, and where there are no penalties for false testimony and there are essentially no forensic capabilities. The rate of not guilty findings is likely to be higher if those due process protections were allowed. \n\nIn conclusion, the discouragement of cross examination should be removed. Any new guidance should emphasize the importance of impartial processes and suggest methods to remove the obvious conflict of interest that universities have in conducting the adjudications. Finally, the following statement on page 12 of the 2011 DCL should be removed: \"schools should ensure that steps taken to accord due process rights to the alleged perpetrator do not restrict or unnecessarily delay the Title IX protections for the complainant.\" This is an egregious infringement on constitutional rights. It is also a glaring example of the complainant friendly bias inherent in the guidance documents. \n","2483":"Dept. of Education's letter in 2011 to schools requiring them to investigate sexual assault or risk losing federal funding must be repealed.  My brother went missing years ago and has never been found and I have been a victims advocate my whole life.  Someone who rapes another individual is capable of committing other crimes such as kidnapping and murdering another, so why in the world would you leave it up to school administrators to investigate a crime?  And if the logic is that it takes away the opportunity for someone to get an education, so does a murderer, but you don't see colleges investigating murders.  Colleges are getting it wrong as evidenced by lawsuits by both the accused and accusers.  At my son's college which is a public institution with over 30,000 students the title ix investigator is a former English teacher.  If schools were truly concerned they would be hiring true professionals trained to investigate crimes, and lawyers and judges to oversee hearings.   But wait, that is what we have the justice system for.  The schools administrators are more concerned about being sued by a so called victim they immediately label an accuser a \"survivor\" or \"victim\" regardless of the facts of the case.  Administrators are showing a clear bias and any real investigator will tell you that you can not get to the truth if there is bias.  If our justice system is broken reform there but to allow college administrators to play judge and jury in cases like these is absolutely ridiculous.  There are people who have truly been raped and they go to these kangaroo courts thinking this is going to bring them some type of closure and justice (really) and they are humiliated that much more in front of untrained and unprofessional staff who have been given \"titles\" by a school because the school was told to by a letter rec'd by Dept. of Education..  And then there are young falsely  accused students whose lives are being ruined and denied an education because a school is being allowed to label them a rapist.  These are serious allegations and must be treated seriously.  Schools are proving over and over again that they are ill equipped to handle these cases.  They were never set up to investigate crimes outside of people cheating on a test or petty theft. Repeal Title IX, it is doing more harm than good.

Forty-eight percent (48%) of fall 2016 credit students received financial aid during their enrollment at HCC.   Seventy-one percent (71%) of our aid recipients are Pell Grant students.  Thirty percent (30%) of our aid recipients borrowed from the student loan programs, which is 10% of our enrolled students.\n\nWe concur with the comments submitted by the American Association of Community Colleges, and would like to emphasize a few of the points made by AACC in the comments below.\n\nProgram Integrity:  Gainful Employment Regulations\n\nWe are pleased that ED has already undertaken the process to reopen negotiated rulemaking proceedings to modify the gainful employment (GE) regulations.  We agree with the basic approach to create GE eligibility metrics for individual GE programs, which show whether students who complete GE programs are subsequently able to repay their student loans without undue burden in a reasonable time period. Our understanding is that the vast majority of community college GE programs were never in any danger of failing the debt-to-earnings metric (and none did).    Howard Community College has 27 GE programs, and only one program had earnings published (verified student count of 17 with median earnings  of $60,704 and mean earnings of $58,273) and no programs had a sufficient number of borrowers for a debt to earnings ratio to be published.   The cost of implementing the GE regulations is enormous, involving staff across many academic and administrative office, and there was no benefit to our students.\n\nWe recommend that the GE regulations should exempt institutions and\/or programs that have a history of low borrowing. Most community colleges have well below 50% of their students borrowing federal loans.   Only about 10% of HCC's enrolled students borrow from the loan program, and even far less than that percentage of students who are enrolled specifically in the GE programs.    Therefore we recommend that our GE programs should be exempted from the current GE reporting regulations and any new GE regulations, other than some basic program disclosures referred to below. \n\nAdditionally, we agree with AACC's recommendation that a minimum threshold be set for the number of Title IV students enrolled in the program in order to require reporting on GE programs to align with confidentiality and other rules. This includes almost all of HCC's GE programs.\n\nReturn of Title IV Funds:  \n\nThese regulations are the most complex of the Title IV regulations and they are the most difficult to implement in a community college.

The complexity is not in the math, but in the gathering of the correct enrollment data for the calculation.   The reason why this area remains one of the top 3 findings in program reviews and audits for the past decade is not because colleges do not put the time and effort into complying, it's because it's too complex to automate and too complex to be able to reliably do a manual calculation for hundreds of students each term.   HCC has surveyed other community colleges and on average, it takes about 30 minutes per withdrawn student to complete the r2t4 calculation process from start to finish.   The ACE report proposes modifications to several provisions of these regulations to ease the burden of compliance. \n\nVerification and ISIR Comment Codes: \n\nIt's the highest need students, Pell eligible applicants, who are most subject to having to gather additional documentation to validate the information they submitted on the FAFSA.

If data is not collected, equitable policies cannot be implemented or monitored. The public must know how schools treat all students and whether they treat students differently based on background. I am disturbed by our country's history of transforming slaves into criminals and delinquents through practices and policies at school and in the community. If we hide data that has historically proven disciplinary practices to overwhelmingly affect students of color and American Indian students, de facto discrimination will continue.\n\nThe Department is proposing to change the 2017-2018 CRDC to reduce the burden on school districts.  However, the Departments primary goal must be to collect all the data needed to ensure that schools and districts are upholding the civil rights of all students, especially students of color and other student groups that often face discrimination, including students with disabilities and students who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ). Communities must also have all the information they need to accurately assess the quality of their schools and districts and to support local efforts to advocate for improvements when needed. Thank you for considering the following recommendations:\n\nI.Collect data on police use of force against students\n\nThe Department should collect data on police use of force against students including: number of students subjected to pepper spray, tasers, physical attack (e.g. tackling, body slamming, etc.), and number of students injured or killed by a firearm. Data on police use of force against students would provide education officials and community members additional information on the impact of school police on students well-being and school safety, as well as provide additional evidence to support local efforts to end the regular presence of police in schools. \n\nII.Disaggregate discipline data by reason for the disciplinary action\n\nStudents of color, students with disabilities, and students who identify as LGBTQ are often disproportionately disciplined for minor, subjective offenses such as disobedience and disruptive behavior. The Department should disaggregate all data on practices that push students out of the classroom (e.g. in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, referrals to law enforcement, and school-related arrests) for this reason. This will provide important information about how many and which students are disciplined for non-violent, subjective offenses. These data would help to show if trainings for school staff and school administrators, as well as other interventions, are needed to prevent and address discrimination. \nCollect data on the use of alternative discipline practices\nSchools and districts should indicate whether or not they are implementing restorative practices or School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports. This would allow comparisons of discipline rates and disparities between schools and districts implementing these approaches and those that are not, which would provide families and community members the evidence they need to advocate for these practices in their own communities. \n\nIII.Ensure that all discipline data is disaggregated by race, sex, disability, and LEP and is reported on an annual basis\n\n Some of the CRDCs data elements related to school discipline are not disaggregated by race, sex, and Limited English Proficiency. This leaves out important information about the outcomes for several student groups. The Department should fully disaggregate all data elements related to discipline to ensure that outcomes for all student groups are tracked. \n\nThe Department should also collect data through the CRDC each year. Current data is needed to identify and address disparities as soon as possible to limit the negative impact on students. Ensuring that families, community members, and advocates have access to the most recent data would also prevent school and district officials from claiming that issues from previous school years have been resolved when older data is used to advocate for improvements. \n\nSincerely,\nAara Johnson","2489":"I am writing on behalf of the Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired and the thousands of individuals we serve every year to express our strong concern and opposition to rules enacted by the Department of Education in 2016. \n\nThe Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ABVI), founded in 1911, is a premiere provider of vision rehabilitation services to people who are blind or visually impaired throughout the Greater Rochester Finger Lakes, and Southern Tier areas of New York. ABVI-Goodwill is dedicated to carrying out its mission to prepare and empower people who are blind or visually impaired to be self-sufficient and contribute to their families and communities.  \n \nIn 2014, Congress passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which reauthorized and reformed the nations workforce development programs. The vocational rehabilitation final rule issued in August 2016 contained language that is of great concern to the blindness community and threatens the ability for those who are blind or visually impaired to receive critical services and meaningful employment. We believe the general language was a regulatory overreach and not what Congress had originally intended. WE are asking that Congress right these wrongs so that blind and visually impaired Americans are afforded the opportunities they need and deserve.   \n\nWE understand that there has been considerable debate about whether our employment opportunities are considered integrated. Under WIOA, the definition of an integrated work setting was combined with the definition of competitive employment to create what is now referred to as competitive integrated employment.    Although the integration definition did not change in WIOA, there was language included in the rule issued in August 2016 by the Education Department which limits access to certain employment opportunities. \nWe feel strongly that individuals who are blind or visually impaired should have the right to choose whether to work at a not-for-profit organization without fear of losing federal benefits such as employment assistance, job training or other associated rehabilitation. These AbilityOne jobs are employment opportunities that provide individuals who are blind or visually impaired the chance to work while earning income and gaining vital employment skills. For some, this is a stepping stone that is needed prior to working in the community at a more competitive employment level.\n    \nThe Department of Education also overreached in the VR rule when it made the discretionary decision to eliminate the category of uncompensated outcomes, which includes the Homemaker Exemption. Even though Congress was not required to do so in WIOA, the Education Department eliminated this category because they did not feel that uncompensated outcomes fit into the definition of competitive integrated employment. The problem with the elimination of the homemaker category is that individuals are not given time to adjust or adapt to their new vision loss before being expected to have a vocational goal. For many, vision loss can be sudden and often very traumatic. Individuals facing such loss are overwhelmed and struggling with basic daily living skills to be safe and independent in their homes and can hardly imagine the thought of writing resumes and going to interviews. \n\nAs a professional working in a blindness organization for almost 20 years  who has worked with many blind and visually impaired individuals and as someone who is blind myself, I can attest to the overwhelming challenges when first facing vision loss.

This cant happen if there isnt a standard agreed braille code taught at ALL schools with a blind\/low vision student learning the world through braille. I understand school testing using the Universal English Braille Code (UBE) as a means of evaluating braille comprehension\/test giving. YET I do NOT understand why some schools are pushing for UBE in mathematics!!! That would be like sending your highschool student to his AP calculus class with just a hand calculator from the dollar store!!!!!

When a school or a school district doesnt treat students fairly and allows discrimination, civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in. In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them, and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have, regulations (or rules) and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law. I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve.\n\nOur education system is unfair to too many students and communities. Students who are Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, immigrants, English learners, girls, LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success. We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve.  Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them. I strongly oppose any effort to rescind, modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws.\n\nWe know from decades of strong empirical research that children need to feel safe in their environments in order to grow to their full potentials. Rescinding protections for groups of children affected by these regulations undoubtedly places them in harm's way by exposing them to additional hardships beyond those experienced in their daily lives. School is a place where children need to feel safe, as 1) many of them might not feel safe in other environments; as such school should be a safe haven for them, and 2) children will not learn to the best of their abilities if they are facing discrimination in their learning environments. It is the Department of Educations job to help our nations schools provide high-quality education for all children.

To be effective, however, the federal government must enforce the law, provide oversight, and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized. Current federal regulations and guidance help all students receive the benefit of our civil rights laws and must be protected. Thats why I am adding my comment today to defend the civil rights of all students. \n\nOver and over again, the Trump Administration has shown contempt for womens rights and civil rights. But, if these past few months have shown us anything, it is that collectively, we have the power to stop this unconscionable backsliding when we raise our voices together. We simply cannot accept sexist, racist, ableist, or xenophobic bigotry in our schools. The time to act is now. \n\nPlease do the right thing and stop this now.

This is an unfortunate confluence of multiple regulations that combines to cause an incredible amount of paperwork for school agencies.\n\nWhen parents enroll their families in Medicaid or their children in the CHIP program, they are explicitly giving permission for medical providers to send their family's information to the state Medicaid agency in order to submit and pay claims for provided medical services.\n\nHowever, information about medical services provided by school districts is classified as \"educational records\" and their disclosure falls under FERPA (34 CFR part 99).  FERPA requires written parental consent to release educational records.  FERPA does list exceptions where parental consent is not required.  However, sending medical information for billing purposes to the state Medicaid agency is not one of the listed exceptions.\n\nFurther, IDEIA 2004 (20 USC 1400) contains a requirement for school agencies to obtain written parental consent before their child's information is sent to the state Medicaid agency.  This requirement is in line with FERPA and indeed is a codified reminder to school agencies to follow FERPA requirements.  USDE clarified the ambiguity in this language with a final regulation in Feb. 2013 (which was effective in March 2013) that stated the consent was a one-time consent.  However, there are circumstances that could require a school agency to obtain the consent more often and by default, many school agencies still are going through the extra work of obtaining this written parental consent on an annual basis.\n\nThese educational record protections are meant to prevent unauthorized disclosures of educational records.  However, the \"educational records\" related to school district Medicaid billing are truly medical treatment records that parents (or guardians) have already explicitly approved for transmission to the state Medicaid agency.  That approval was granted when they enrolled their children in the state's Medicaid program.\n\nThe information that the state Medicaid agency receives is:\n - the patient (student) Medicaid ID\n - the provider Medicaid ID\/NPI\n - the service code\n - the amount of service\n - the date\n\nAs far as the state Medicaid agency is concerned, this \"educational record\" could just as well be coming information coming from a doctor's office.  There is nothing to indicate that this is a \"student\" receiving medical service or just a \"child\" receiving medical service.\n\nThe request to eliminate the paperwork, the time, and the administrative overhead for all public school agencies would be to provide regulations\/guidance that eliminates the need for school agencies to obtain this unnecessary consent.  This could be done through regulations or, working with Congress, amending IDEIA to remove the consent provision or amending FERPA to add an exception to obtaining parental consent to the existing list of exceptions in the act.\n\nThank you!","2623":"Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,\n\nEveryone should have an equal chance to succeed, but our lives are not equal.

Where did the groups that are using the \"Dear Colleague\" letter for their own agenda get the power to\n override the justice system? The April 4, 2011, Dear Colleague letter is guidance and recommendations only; however, with \nthe threat of removal of federal funding, this letter all of a sudden became a mandate of sorts. In the case of my nephew, who\n was wrongfully accused and ultimately suspended from a major university, that university gets 500M from the federal \ngovernment. There is NO WAY they would put that in jeopardy so what happens?  Over-correction happens. My family is \nheartened that there is a chance this overly-egregious Title IX over-reach is reversed. It will take a strong and fierce effort to do\n so because the victim-advocate side has a ton of money and NO problem living in the public, as opposed to those that are\nwrongfully accused like my nephew, who live in the shadows and only until recently, some of them have been willing to put\n themselves out there to say how wrong this is. My nephew is too fearful to speak out. The accuser's family has already \nproven they are not afraid of shaming him publicly and he just wants to move on; however, his 'move on' means that he isn't at\n the college of his dreams, he's lost many of his friends, he's in a constant state of depression waiting for another shoe to drop,\n and his dream of playing professional basketball has been stopped completely because of a false accusation. So please find\n the strength to make the necessary adjustments and REQUIRE the universities to institute practices that are substantive, \nmeaningful and fair to both sides.\n\nThree other items of concern and consideration for your thoughts: \n1) What happens to all of those that were wrongfully accused and ultimately suspended? I would request that you allow those\n that were accused of sexual misconduct or assault, investigated by the police and\/or judicial system andNOT charged, to be \nallowed some sort of retro-action that would allow them to seek their innocence under any new rules\/regulations you put in \nplace.  I know there are hundreds of kids that are in this position - including my nephew, and although he has zero desire to go back to that school, he needs to clear\nhis name! \n2) Alcohol. You need to address the alcohol situation. I would argue this 'liquid courage' is the #1 reason these false \naccusations occur. Have youbeen on a college campus lately? Go there on 'Thirsty Thursday' and see the behavior of young\n females all jacked up on 'liquid courage'. In the case of mynephew, they were both intoxicated, and SHE CAME AFTER HIM.\nThose at the party that were interviewed, testified to this to the TIX coordinator. Yet, because she was intoxicated, she was\n deemed as in a state of 'black-out'. How was my nephew to know this when she went after him? I encourage you to send\nyour interns onto college campuses and go to bars on Thursday nights and just watch. You'll see that Candice Jackson's \nstatement was right on, and she's being vilified for it. Crazy. \n3) Consideration of some sort of mediation as the first step in the process once an accusation is made. If you ask a \nprofessionalmediator on how this should be handled, they could tell you perfectly how this should be done. This would take\n care of 3rd party accusers (like my nephew's situation as it was her brother that called 'rape'), allow the alleged accuser and \nthe accused to find an appropriate resolution that agreeable to both parties - WITHOUT the influence of friends and family.

I was told by my school district when my son was approaching his third birthday, that he should be \"sent to a nice, residential placement out of state\" because he would ruin my life. I wouldn't allow him to be sent away, but once he started school, it became clear to me that this recommendation was made because no one in my school district, or pretty much in my entire state, knew how to provide an individualized, appropriate education for him. How different that would have been should interveners have been around in 1992!\n\nI did my best as his advocate, mom, and yes, teacher, too, although, in hindsight, he was the real teacher. Because of him, I've learned to appreciate the human condition and the value that everyone brings to our society. Raising a child who was both deaf and blind wasn't easy. I struggled - on my own - to learn sign language and braille, to support his school staff in being able to bring the environment and the world to him, and to understand worlds that were completely new to me. \n\nDeafBlindness is not the same as deafness plus blindness. It's a separate and unique disability. But no one - not one person on my son's team - had expertise in DeafBlindness. He had a 1:1 teacher of the deaf, 1:1 teacher of the blind, orientation and mobility instructors, occupational and physical therapists, and sign language interpreters, who were all restricted, due to their knowledge, skills, and job descriptions, in the kinds of supports they could provide. No one person was allowed to do it all, even the braille teacher who really wanted to. How much more he would have gained by having an intervener! Not that an intervener can replace a teacher or a therapist, but by being there with the child as he or she interacts with the specialists, the intervener can then reinforce the concepts, language, academics, socialization, and behaviors continually, throughout the day. Appropriate repeated and ongoing repetition and explanations are often necessary for children, and especially for children who don't see or hear. What a benefit that would have provided for my son! Instead, each professional had their little niche, and was not able to step outside of it, and provided their role at predictable times throughout the day or week, as regulated by the IEP. Instead of his education focusing on providing the most appropriate education for him, it revolved around which staff fit into the right box that might meet part of his needs. \n\nNothing is more important in raising a child than a strong and loving family; however, when your family includes a child who has challenges accessing the world through vision and sight, a team of professionals trained in DeafBlindness is necessary. Parents and teaching staff need to be able to provide appropriate interventions and skills immediately, not while experimenting with a staff who may have some, but not all of the skills and tools and will definitely experience a \"learning curve,\" resulting in lost months, and in some cases, years.  Every DeafBlind child will present differently; however, trained interveners will have the background, knowledge and flexibility to be able to step up and begin providing services immediately, honing their skills as they become accustomed to the child's needs.\n\nAfter being told by the so-called professionals who had no idea of how to educate him that my son would \"ruin\" my life, I'm proud to say that he's now a college junior majoring in art therapy (feel free to check out his own artwork at jongabryart.com). Art has allowed him to express himself, including the challenges he faces every day, and he hopes to bring that gift to others with different abilities. He is a pleasant and happy young man, an honor student, and an experienced presenter who has shared his story in the hopes of educating professionals in the fields, of medicine, education, and disability.\n\nEvery child has gifts, talents, and the ability to contribute. Please give DeafBlind children the chance to find these qualities in themselves by including professional, trained interveners in the list of  acceptable Related Services.

When we start to meet with a deafblind child s home school district to write up an Individual Education Plan (IEP) after it is determined the child is eligible for special education services including preschool, we need to add to the IEP that the deafblind child needs access to ed l pucational input by having an intervener. And the list of Related Services does not include Intervener. So we need to add intervener to that list.\n\nJust assigning an aide, teacher s aide, paraeducator or an interpreter is not appropriate because none of them had a training on how to communicate and guide a deafblind child in educational setting. I have observed an aide trying to work with her. She did not provide visual information including what the peers were doing, signing, saying, etc. For example, they were learning how to bowl and the child had no clue and have not experience bowling so I stopped the bowling and brought a deafblind girl to touch the ball, lane and pins then showed a person holding a ball and feeling the bowler bowling then feel the pins were hit and fell. During that process, i signed in her hands so she can associate action with language.\n\nAnother example was when it was time to line up, she didnt know they were lining up so need to let her know they are now lining up for lunch or to wash hands and show her where everyone is in line by touching each peer. \n\nAnother example, when they sat in a circle on floor for circle time, she needed to be informed what they are doing and where they are sitting then during storytime, she needs to know what the teacher is saying or signing by interpreting and what her peers say and sign by interpreting and if she has enough vision, have her see the book or if she does not have vision, touch a tactile book of the same title to assure she has quality access to education.\n\nSo I strongly recommend that the word \"Intervener\" should be on the list of related services and that the school should hire a trained intervener.  We have training in United States for a person to attend to learn how to be an intervener. \n\nIf you have any question, please feel free to contact me at lazywisteria@gmail.com\n\nThank you, Karen Philo of Renton, Washington ","2646":"Dear Secretary DeVos\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on your efforts to understand the issue of sexual misconduct on college campuses and hopefully to repeal the guidance contained in the Dear Colleague Letters issued by the Obama Administration.  As the parent of a falsely accused son and as a lawyer, I have been directly impacted by the unfair and biased procedures that the DCL has mandated.  The current situation is harmful for actual victims of sexual misconduct as well as those whom are being wrongfully accused.  The definition of \"sexual violence\" can include a vast array of interpersonal contact ranging from a \"harmless\" cat call or sideways glance up to and including violent forcible rape.  Accordingly, the accused (mostly young men) are being found responsible under draconian rules and proceedings and then drummed out of their colleges and universities via longterm suspension and\/or expulsion.  Transcripts marked with the scarlet letter of Sexual Assault basically precludes transfer or any way to obtain a college degree.  Lives are being ruined\n\nThe statistics being bandied about by social justice warriors are so outlandish that it is actually amazing that any responsible parent would ever send their child to college.  Why in the world would anyone pay up to $75K per year to an elite University if their son or daughter faced a 25-50% chance of being raped?  The logical answer is that the threat is not real.  The hysteria is overblown but purposely so in order to justify the DCL and the myriad administrator positions and salaries they command. \n\nAs an officer in the 501 (c)(3) Families Advocating Campus Equality (FACE) I am responsible for interviewing all families who contact our organization.  Since January over 110 families have reached out seeking help for their wrongfully accused children.  Your willingness to meet with some of these families was so important and as a result you know well the damage that has been done.  \n\nThis is an enormously complicated issue and it is one that needs carefully crafted solutions.  Sexual assault is horrific and cannot be tolerated, but the DCL has done much more harm than good.  Nobody is happy.   \n\nYears ago I worked as a regulatory attorney in DC and know well the importance of the APA and the need for binding regulations to be promulgated only after notice to the American people and the chance for interested parties to submit comments.  The DCL has been used to weaponize Title IX and to strong arm Colleges and Universities into compliance with its \"guidance\" with threats of funding withdrawal.  Interestingly, the DCL is not law and it is not binding on any institution but the hollow threats certainly do cause schools to walk lockstep.  \n\nI urge you to continue to listen to all parties and repeal the DCL guidance until and unless new regulations are promulgated according to the APA.   It is hard to watch the activists bully you and your office.

This is a real threat since the Dear Colleague was sent and it clearly stated this was the case. Boys now face a kangaroo court put on by the school that denies them the most basic and fair rights granted to them by our constitution. But constitutional rights have no bearing on how the schools decide your guilt they make there own rules because this is not court. Yet they are deciding a young mans fate for the rest of life. The accused has no rights he is deemed guilty from the start and removed from the school shortly after the accusation less he be threat to any other student. But he has only been accused not convicted not even tried at this point only accused. Even when a true court of law decides a young man is innocent the school deems they and their appointed board are somehow more qualfiyed to determine your guilt and decide your fate. \nTitle 9 needs to be changed back to its original purpose or simply removed all together ","2659":"I do hope the Dept. of Education rescinds the current Dear Colleague Letter and policies that have destroyed the lives of those falsely accused and properly puts all accusations of a felony sexual assault or rape into the hands of law enforcement where it belongs.

While every accuser deserves to be heard, the same needs to happen for the accused .   Due process is a constitutional right. Not an inconvenience.   \n\nWhile everyone's claim of being a victim of sexual assault and rape must be taken seriously, there must be constitutional rights to due process for those accused of such a serious crime. Never should a campus tribunal be used to decide guilt or innocence of anyone in such a life changing accusation.  Too many innocent lives have been destroyed by the current system that states all accusations of rape and sexual assault are to believed.  Period.  No questions asked.  That is how the current biased system works. No cross examination of the accuser allowed. No attorney can speak during questioning of the accused. Many times the accused isn't even given the details of what he\/she is accused of. And many instances can be seen of evidence being disallowed that would prove one's innocence.  Pressure to find guilt and bias that no accuser lies (they are all to be believed) makes it easy for innocent individuals to have their lives destroyed by those that falsely accuse. The constitution provides the right to due process under the law and equality under the law. The current system denies those rights to the falsely accused and renders them helpless against a stacked biased system.  When an accused individual would be best served by a coin toss over a tribunal biased against him (since that tribunal only needs to be 50.01% sure of the accuser's account where the tribunal is already been instructed that they are to believe the accuser, not the accused. Thus an unbiased coin would be a better method of determining an accused's guilt or innocence when the accused is truly innocent.) there is something wrong with the current system.  \nThere are many cases seen where there are false accusations made or where the accuser doesn't even remember the events clearly- due to alcohol or drugs.  Caleb Warner is one of many such examples. The Hofstra rape case where if not for a cell phone video being allowed to be presented, those men would still be in jail today is another example.  The Duke Lacrosse case is another example, where if that case had gone to the campus tribunal, those men would be expelled still and be branded rapists for life. Only DNA evidence cleared them, which is not something a campus tribunal would be looking to investigate at all.  The University of VA case is another case where the accused had to flee campus based solely on an accusation. That woman was believed as instructed by the current system. Only some fine questioning by some journalists seems to have led to the truth.  \nWe must abide by the constitution of the United States and allow those accused to have a fair and balanced chance to defend themselves.  The current system does not afford the accused to do so.  They have no due process. No constitutional rights to prove their innocence.  These cases must go to true legal authorities for investigation as they have the proper training and proper tools to do so.  Campus tribunals do not have either.  Also, if the accusations are true, imprisonment is the proper punishment, not to be expelled from campus to be set free to sexually assault or rape in the general population.  \n\nFor the reasons explained, I do hope the Dept. of Education rescinds the current Dear Colleague Letter and policies that have destroyed the lives of those falsely accused and properly puts all accusations of a felony sexual assault or rape into the hands of law enforcement where it belongs.

This concomitant loss creates a disability of access to information:  information about the environment, about people, about communication, and about the curriculum.  With the two major sensory channels of obtaining information impacted, any information a child who is deafblind receives is likely to be distorted, incomplete, unreliable, and misunderstood. This makes it difficult for children to learn and develop language and concepts. Many school personnel are unaware of the impact of a combined vision and hearing loss, and thus do not understand the needs of these children. A qualified and trained intervener can help bridge the information gap by providing consistent information to the child through the use of deafblind strategies. Over the past 20 years the use of trained interveners has increased throughout the country, and is recognized by OSEP as a credible service delivery option. In fact, OSEP supported the development and use of 26 online training modules for interveners and other educational team members. In Arizona, we have an in-depth two-year Intervener Team Training Program that entire educational teams attend together, and over the past several years we've trained over 300 team members.\n\nYet, many educators and administrators still are not aware of what intervener services are or how very much they support children who are deafblind. Even when they learn what interveners are and why they are needed, many administrators hesitate to provide such a service because they are not part of existing law at the national level.  Having qualified interveners on the list of related services for children who are deafblind would greatly increase the possibility that children with combined vision and hearing losses would receive this critical service as part of the IEP.

Headquartered in New Britain, CT, we employ over 1,000 individuals with significant disabilities in meaningful and well-paying jobs throughout the country, many of whom are employed at military bases and prestigious government facilities as a direct result of the AbilityOne program.  \nOur comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations and guidance are stripping away the rights of people with disabilities by closing off meaningful and well-paying jobs for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \nIn the absence of the AbilityOne program, many of the individuals we serve would not be employed or would be working in lower paying positions with minimal to no benefits.  The unemployment rate for people with disabilities continues to be high, despite good intentions and various policies designed to increase employment.  Eliminating and limiting job opportunities for any group of people, specifically for people with significant disabilities is unfair and disheartening. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA not only restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities; it is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance. As an employer in a number of states, some of the vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies are discounting any AbilityOne job which is problematic and can lead to unfilled positions.  \nWe respectfully request that the DoEd immediately rescind the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne Program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). This is an Employment First approach which not only supports \n\nindividual choice but will lead to the employment for many individuals with significant disabilities in the future. \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSandra M.

Trained interveners are a necessary service provider for children with deafblindness no matter what the students ages are or skills and language may be. Deafblindness is the result of any combination of hearing loss and vision loss. Interveners are able to adapt to work with students and not for them. They seek out opportunities for students to access and make connections with things, people, and the environment. They are responsible for the child's social and emotional development, as well. They work as a paraprofessional under the direction of a credentialed teacher. Intervener services are currently being used in some states, but not in all.\n\nThere is a definitive lack of access to education for students with deafblindness. Deafblindness is a low incidence disability which results in a low incidence of teachers who are familiar or capable of teaching a child with deafblindness. Typically, what is happening is that a student spends years not getting an ACCESSIBLE education, which is every student's CIVIL RIGHT regardless of any disability they have. This is a major problem.\n\nIt is time for students with deafblindness to have ACCESS to a free and public education without being overlooked. Deafblindness is not a life sentence to dependency or sitting alone not knowing things and waiting for someone to tell them what to do! People with deafblindness, when given the right kind of tools and support are able to learn language, communicate, learn, and work independently can blossom as self-actualized people without any deficits. But they must be given access to the world as early as possible. Interveners are the bridge between the deafblind-world and teachers and education staff who simply are not trained in how to work with children who have this low-incidence disability. Without this bridge students with deafblindness are experiencing a disservice. It is not their fault they they are deafblind. It is not their fault that not enough teachers know how to work with them. The Department of Education needs to step up and add intervener services to the related services list. Having interveners provides students with deafblindness the appropriate access to education that students with deafblindness have a right to.\n\nStudents with deafness are provided interpreters or c-pint as a related service to that they can access their education. interpreters and c-print typists are NOT trained, capable, or qualified to do what an intervener does for a student with deafblindness. It is time to look at deafblindness as a specific category, apart from deafness. Deafblindness is more than a hearing loss. More than a vision loss. It is the combination of the individual's loss that makes the way a student with deafblindness learns unique to that individual. Interveners are trained to find out what works for a student with deafblindness, and gauge what will propel them forward in their academics and social and emotional development.\n\nIt is time to add \"Intervener Services\" to the list of Related Services as an option for students with Deafblindness.\n\nPlease view the following references:\n\nOpen Hands, Open Access Intervener Modules.

These two contracts provided $410,000 in wages and health and welfare benefits to persons with disabilities in 2016.

This comment is in regards to regulations and sub-regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd), Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) for the purpose of implementing the integrated settings criteria under the definition of competitive integrated employment [34 CFR 361.5(c)(9)(ii) and 361.5(c)(32)(ii)] in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These regulations and guidance are having an unintentional, but deleterious, job-killing impact for people with significant disabilities. Specifically, RSAs guidance is indiscriminately disqualifying vocational rehabilitation job placements to certain nonprofit agencies (NPAs) based upon their participation in the congressionally-mandated U.S. AbilityOne Program. \nThe language in the integrated settings criteria promulgated by RSA restricts access to quality competitive integrated jobs for people with disabilities and is inconsistent with other parts of the regulation, the departments longstanding practice and technical guidance. My states vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency is one of many states VR that have stopped referring and placing individuals with disabilities through NPAs that participate in the AbilityOne Program. This equates to over 80 individuals for 2017 based on previous years.\nPhoenix is an NPA participating in the AbilityOne Program and creates hundreds of jobs for individuals with disabilities. Because referrals and placements from state vocational rehabilitation counselors have ceased employment opportunities at my agency are going un-filled. Deserving individuals with significant disabilities are denied these opportunities and the ability to be a vital part of our community.  \nWe request that the DoEd immediately rescinds the FAQ guidance (posted on DoEds website, https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/rsa\/wioa\/competitive-integrated-employment-faq.html ) related to the definition of integrated settings and issue clarifying guidance and that employment at community rehabilitation programs, including employment positions funded through the AbilityOne program, may be considered competitive integrated employment as long as it meets the criteria defined in RSA-TAC-06-01 and the WIOA (P.L. 113-128). \nThank you for the opportunity to comment on existing regulations that eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation.\nSincerely,\nDavid Perez, COO\nPhoenix\nHuntsville, AL\n","2695":"I request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services. Trained interveners are difference-makers for DeafBlind children no matter what the children's ages are or skills and language they have. They are able to adapt to work WITH the child and not FOR the child, they seek out opportunities for the child to access and make connections with things, people and the environment, they are responsible for the child's social and emotional development. Yes, education of DeafBlind children is a very young field. Even with early DeafBlind people, Laura Bridgman (b. 1829) and Helen Keller (b. 1880) (www.perkins.org), it is still new compared to public education and Deaf Education. In the short time this field has grown, knowledge and skills, for which there are currently Council for Exceptional Children standards (CEC link below), in interveners have proven time and time again it is a best practice in the education of DeafBlind children. My 7 year-old DeafBlind son is one of these students fortunate to have been assigned interveners over the years, his first one was when he was 3 years old. It was at that school and the first time for my son, the IEP team voluntarily listed intervener services, which he received 1875 minutes of per week, under Related Services in his IEP document. With the support of personnel skilled and experienced with DeafBlind children, including interveners, he is walking more, drinking via straw, making choices when offered, making progress with requesting things or actions of other people. Most important of all, he is happier on these school days where he can understand what's happening and has been \"heard\" by competent people who understand him. Unfortunately this is not true for all DeafBlind children during the critical early years of their life. Caregivers, one-on-one aides, nurses, volunteers who are not trained or experienced in this field do not reach the level of efficiency in schools that interveners bring. The good news is that there are training resources available, some are online resources and online training programs through a few universities. One of them is a 27-module online resource developed by the National Center on DeafBlindness, funded by the Office of Special Education Programs called Open Hands, Open Access Intervener Modules (OHOA). There is national intervener certification available through NICE (National Intervener Certification E-Portfolio) that is based on the CEC intervener skills and knowledge standards. By modifying the Related Services list to include Intervener Services, it opens the door to educate, empower and enable our early intervention, K-12 professionals and particularly DeafBlind children to successfully access education currently offered to all the children in our country.

Please note that many of the comments are verbatim, which clearly indicates a group of people with an agenda to maintain the current biases found in your existing policies has urged their followers to blindly copy and paste those boilerplated comments.  \n\nIt is tacitly understood that civil rights need to be protected for ALL.  It is also tacitly understood that the word \"all\" means ALL people irrespective of race, gender, class, etc.  The policies of the prior administration which you have inherited do NOT protect the civil rights of ALL students.  Those policies, which are now YOUR policies, give preference to some which unfairly hurts the excluded ones.  As an Asian female with the upbringing of an \"underprivileged\" immigrant parent, I could have been a direct beneficiary of such unfair preferences for minorities, females, and the underprivileged.  However, my moral fiber could not stomach the thought of partaking in such tacitly supported inequality.\n\nI encourage you to ensure and support fair treatment, impartiality, and due process safeguards for ALL students by eliminating, revising, and rewording your existing policies that currently DO NOT provide this basic level of fairness to ALL.\n\nIn particular, your policies currently do NOT guarantee due process for ALL students.  Granting due process to ALL people, irrespective of race, gender, class, etc. is the cornerstone of the founding of these United States of America and is a protected right granted to ALL by our Constitution.  To deny due process in any forum is not only a violation of our Constitution, it is in direct opposition to all that we stand for in our country.  We are ALL supposed to be innocent UNTIL proven guilty.  \n\nMoreover, as you continue to deny due process protection from students in a college setting, you are hurting the young and most vulnerable of our population.  While technically at the age of 18 people are considered legal \"adults\", science has conversely proven with extensive brain research and documentation that people's brains continue to mature well into their twenties, and many 18-25 year olds are still, like children, prone to making impulsive and impetuous decisions (i.e.: drinking in excess, having sex, regretting it all later, and then claiming he\/she was raped as the irrational and immature way of dealing with those feelings of regret or unrequited attraction).  Since the majority of students on any given campus are under 25 years old, not only are you currently denying due process from your students with your existing policies, you are also denying due process protection from the most vulnerable on your campus; those who are probably away from any adult guidance and supervision for the first time in their lives and desperately need due process protection.  \n\nYour current policies lead to a student (male or female) who has been falsely accused of rape to be immediately determined to be guilty without any thorough investigation or representation.  That student then becomes expelled for a rape he\/she may in truth NOT have committed. The impact on a student receiving such a punishment for a potential false accusation is devastating beyond imagination.  No one in their right mind would stand for this treatment in our criminal court system, so why can a college campus get away with such unconstitutional treatment of its students?\n\nBottom line:  we are ALL supposed to be innocent UNTIL proven guilty.  No policies should exist anywhere in any forum that contradict that very basic tenet.  Your current policies clearly VIOLATE the basic premise of impartiality, fairness, and due process protection for ALL, and I implore you to right the wrongs of our prior administration by correcting this moral, ethical, and unconstitutional error.\n","2702":"The Nebraska Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, a statewide non-profit advocacy organization committed to the prevention and elimination of sexual and domestic violence, submits these comments in strong support of the 2011 Dear Colleague letter clarifying Title IX's intended purpose of protecting all students from sexual violence and harassment. We support the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) correct clarification that the evidentiary standard in campus disciplinary hearings is preponderance of the evidence.\n \nSexual assault and harassment occurs on Nebraska's college campuses and in education settings. Victims can experience serious, discriminatory harms as the result of their assault or harassment. As such, the issuance of the 2011 Dear Colleague letter was compelled by the acute needs of students. The letter's clarifications of OCR's previous regulatory guidance and enforcement actions are fully consistent with the civil rights approach to discriminatory harassment and the rules in the vast majority of other civil proceedings. Indeed, if OCR had adopted a different approach, it would have engaged in a dangerous kind of exceptionalism for only sexual violence and its victims, the majority of whom are women and girls.\n \nOn behalf of survivors and local programs serving survivors and providing prevention education in Nebraska, we urge the U.S. Department of Education to keep the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter in place, as the extraordinarily helpful existing clarifying guidance articulates necessary, legally correct, and historically-followed standards that help both students and schools.","2703":"Honorable Secretary Betsy DeVos,\n \nI am writing you with grave concern for today's college students.  America's Universities need immediate attention and changes to the way sexual assault and harassment allegations are handled. If a student has wronged another, proper consequence must be enforced. However, our universities have strayed from the founding principles of individual rights and innocence until proven guilty. I have been victimized by unjust and unfair actions of a university and it has devastated me and my family since its occurrence.\n\nI was a student over 50 years old returning to school to add to my education to work in another field.  My wife of more than 20 years and two teen age daughters were all committed to help Dad complete his classes. As parents, we have worked diligently to instruct our girls as Godly people to respect others. As a father, all women must be treated with respect.   My own past and references are impeccable. However, I was falsely accused of sexual harassment at a university, immediately walked out of a school then promptly expelled with no due process at all.  I was then informed in writing that I had \"No Appeal\" and banned from campus. I spent the next several months trying to correct the injustice and get a proper investigation, with no results. I had lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because a school did not follow its' own rules or even the law for that matter.\n\nI hope people in authority, such as you Secretary DeVos, take notice and make chances in a broken system that hurts students and their families. Please fix it, do not let future students go down a road that may be catastrophic. As for me, I will struggle on, forgiving and praying for those that have wronged me, believing God will send my relief someday.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDon Corsaro\n12320 Country Oaks Trail\nChardon, Ohio 44024\ndcorsaro9@gmail.com\n","2704":"I would like to voice strong support for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the regulations that have been promulgated to support its implementation. IDEA and these regulations are critical to continuing the progress made over the last 30 years to ensure young children with or at risk for disabilities and their families receive the services they need to reach their full potential.  As a part of the Continuous System of Personnel Development system in Michigan I see no need to repeal, replace or modify any of the IDEA regulations at this time and note that changes to regulations are better addressed in the context of a re-authorization. The current process is outside the usual order, and as a result, is likely to lack the in-depth stakeholder input and public discussion critical to the success of such an activity.\n\nIDEA and its implementing regulations are designed to address both access to early intervention and special education for children with disabilities, as well as the quality of those services. IDEA Parts A, B and C, outline the rights, responsibilities and infrastructures to ensure access to early intervention and education for eligible children and their families. In Part D, IDEA provides for investments in the quality of those services and infrastructures. Part D provides funding for parent support and information centers and the demonstration and dissemination of evidence based,\neffective practices.\n\nThere is no doubt in the field of education and in the experiences of families, that IDEA is a success. Certainly, there are challenges in implementing such a broad and visionary policy and federal action can indeed assist in these efforts. But the answer to these challenges is not to revise or reduce IDEA regulations. Quite the contrary, these regulations support efforts to implement IDEA successfully. Fully funding IDEA federally would go a long way to addressing the challenges states and communities are facing. \n\nIDEA has a federal infrastructure that implementation science tells us is necessary for the installation of effective practices. This infrastructure includes guidance from OSEP in best practice, accountability, and monitoring. For the early childhood provisions of IDEA (Part C and Section 619 of Part B), OSEP provides policy guidance as needed to state leaders to assist in their efforts to help local early intervention programs and school districts implement effective policies, practices and accountability measures while also holding them accountable to indicators of compliance and quality. \n\nIDEA early childhood programs also serve as a key mechanism of supports and services for young children with disabilities in community settings such as preschool, Head Start, Home Visiting and child care\/early learning. I appreciate the valuable policy guidance that has been released in the last several years through collaboration across federal programs in the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services as well as other federal agencies as needed. This federal collaborative work has resulted in the release of a number of powerful policy statements from the respective Secretaries to assist local programs serving young children in understanding best practice giving all young children opportunities to succeed and be ready for school. Please continue these efforts. State and community leaders speak very highly of these policy statements and express how their use has helped further efforts for young children and families at the community level. Examples of these policy statements include, but are not limited to, high quality inclusion, reducing and eliminating suspension and expulsion, and strengthening partnerships with families. \n\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comment on this important matter.","2705":"\"CFR Title 34, Subtitle III, Chapter III, Part 300, Subpart A, 300.34 Related Services\nI request the modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services.

This will significantly increase the opportunities for children who are deafblind. I am an interverner in New York State. I worked with a deafblind child for 8 years. After I became an intervener our lives changed. After taking classes through Utah State University I finally knew how to teach this child. He learned so much from me and it changed his life for the better.His programing was very disjointed before I became an intervener. No one had ever worked with a deafblind child before. We researched it but it was still all over the place. He knew the difference after I took these classes, he began to sign, one word a time but he was communicating to us. Could you imagine not being able to communicate your wants and needs? This helped him become more independent and happy. He could choose something to eat. It's that simple.  I am a credentialed intervener that was not looked at as a profession through my school. I didn't get a pay raise or acknowledgment, but that didn't matter to me. What mattered to me was; this child needed my services and I was going to provide them for him. He is a happy, smart young man that deserves an education along with all other typical children.

A finding of guilt can \"have a major impact immediate and life-long impact on [their] personal life, education, employment, and public engagement.\" Id.

People with disabilities should have the right to CHOOSE any job they wish to pursue and be supported by the federal and state dollars committed to helping them achieve vocational independence. \n\nthe direction that AbilityOne jobs cannot be considered full and integrated is capricious at best and intentionally designed at worst to eliminate 45,000 well paying potential jobs to VR consumers. to say that an AbilityOne custodian, working in a federal building with hundreds or thousands of federal employees and visitors each day is less integrated than working as a custodian, probably at night with no interaction with the workforce is simply false, wrong and intentionally designed to damage the AbilityOne program.\n\nPeople with disabilities should have EVERY CHOICE possible and be supported by the state VR agency without interference from RSA!","2797":"Employment Outcome definition, 34 CFR 361.5(c)(15)\n\nWe would like to encourage the Department of Education to (1) restore the option for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) to serve individuals who choose a vocational outcome of Homemaker or Unpaid Family Worker, and (2) modify the regulatory definition of \"employment outcome\" to include the language of the statute (29 USC Section 705(11)) that gives the Secretary discretion to determine additional vocational outcomes that may be considered employment outcomes for VR purposes.\n\nWithout this change, some individuals with very significant disabilities will be denied the rehabilitation services that could advance their adjustment and productivity and lead eventually to work outside the home.  For many years the occupation of Homemaker was designated by the Secretary as an occupation that could be considered to be an employment outcome under the VR program.  Under the DOE rules implementing WIOA, the option to serve individuals choosing a Homemaker outcome has been eliminated.  The occupation of Homemaker is one principally (though not exclusively) used by individuals who are blind.  Blindness is traumatic for some individuals, and when the onset is in adulthood, adjustment and skill development can be protracted.  The Homemaker occupation, while requiring extensive training in adaptive techniques and use of assistive technology, is work that provides a plateau where confidence can grow, skills improve, and unique capabilities emerge.  The occupation can be a bridge to other employment.  However, first and foremost, it is work that the individuals should have a right to choose.   For some, it is an occupation that cannot be attained without intensive vocational rehabilitation services.  \n\nThe new regulatory definition of \"employment outcome\" reflects the Rehabilitation Act (WIOA) emphasis on the goal of \"competitive integrated employment.\"  However, the statute noticeably retains the provision for Secretarial discretion in determining the range of vocational results that may be \"employment outcomes\" for which vocational rehabilitation services can be provided.  Retention of the Secretarial discretion regarding employment outcomes suggests that Congress anticipated that some vocational choices might not strictly meet the \"competitive integrated employment\" definition but still have meaningful economic value for the consumer, family and society. \n\nIn addition, the statute maintains its long-standing commitment to informed consumer choice throughout the rehabilitation process.  The occupation of Homemaker is chosen by many today because it applies their skills and has economic value for the family.  It is a mainstream occupation, usually involving full-time work.  Individuals with disabilities should not be denied vocational rehabilitation services they may need in order to pursue this occupation that has a central place in our society, but confers economic benefit in ways other than direct payment of wages.  Similarly, in the case of Unpaid Family Worker employment, the economic benefit to consumer and family are generated and received collectively, not tied to direct payment of wages or individual income.  \n\nHere is a possible way to revise the regulatory definition of \"employment outcome\" to more closely mirror the statute (29 USC 705(11)), affirm the statutory emphasis on informed client choice, and to make it possible for VR to assist individuals who choose to become homemakers or work in a family business:\n\nRecommended change:\nModify the regulatory definition in 34 CFR 361.5(c)(15) to read as follows:\n (15) The term \"employment outcome\" means, with respect to an individual\n(a) entering, advancing in or retaining full-time or, if appropriate, part-time competitive integrated employment as defined in 361.5(c)(9) (including customized employment, self-employment, telecommuting, or business ownership);\n(b) satisfying the vocational outcome of supported employment; or\n(c) satisfying any other vocational outcome the Secretary of Education may determine to be appropriate (including satisfying the vocational outcome of homemaker or unpaid family worker).\n\nRecommended change:\nAnother regulatory adjustment should be made in 361.46(a)(1) to remove the phrase \"consistent with the general goal of competitive integrated employment,\" thus retaining emphasis on informed choice and allowing the client to choose any other employment outcome that may be designated by the Secretary.\n\n","2798":"Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer,\n\nAs a former higher ed professional, I know that these rules are crucial to ensuring students get the protections they need to learn in safe, supportive environments. \n\nAll Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary.

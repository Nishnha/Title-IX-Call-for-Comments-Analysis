the Impact Aid program as the US Department of Education Department engages in an agency wide directive to review all regulations per Executive Order 13777 the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools NAFIS serves as the umbrella organization for four subgroups Military Impacted Schools Association MISA National Indian Impacted Schools Association NIISA Mid to Low LOT Schools MTLLS and Federal Lands Impacted Schools Association FLISA Our members are the leaders superintendents school board members school business officers of federally impacted school districts Our organizations collectively represent the 1 200 plus Impact Aid recipient school districts nationwide that educate over 10 million students Impact Aid is the oldest elementary and secondary education program and its purpose is to reimburse school districts for a loss of local revenue due to the presence of non taxable Federal property such as military installations Indian Treaty Trust or Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act lands Federal low income housing facilities national parks and laboratories Congress recognized in 1950 that the Federal government had an obligation to help meet the local responsibility of financing public education in these communities That same recognition holds true today The staff in the Impact Aid program office work hard each day to provide customer service to more than 1 200 school districts This support includes detailed one on one technical assistance and ensuring that applications are reviewed and payments are disbursed in a timely manner We were pleased with many of the final regulations that updated the Impact Aid program in September of 2016 and provided added flexibility For example permitting multiple students from the same household to be listed on one parent pupil survey form and the so called Pentagon Rule We urge the Department to prioritize the Impact Aid office to ensure there is a full complement of staff and to prioritize modernizing the information technology system For example it is important for the staff to travel throughout the year to provide updates and technical support at conferences and school district site visits In addition we urge the Department to allocate funding to update its internal technology infrastructure for tracking applications disbursing funds and communicating with federally impacted school districts to improve efficiency security and customer service Page 2 of 3 We offer the following recommendations in response to the regulatory reform initiative Electronic Data Count Our members support the updated regulation that would allow a third option to count students within the Basic Support program The Impact Aid Office s establishment of the Electronic Data Count EDC pilot is a first step toward modernizing the application process away from an antiquated paper and pencil system We encourage the Department to codify that school districts may rely on student information systems or other technology to assist with the count and audit of federally impacted students as long as they meet the criteria for counting students As the Department continues to implement the pilot we encourage the Department to review the current regulations to determine if changes are appropriate to better align with an electronic count Federal Properties Application We urge you to use this opportunity to further streamline the application process for Federal Properties school districts We recommend a process similar to the one used by the Department of Interior to distribute annual PILT funding whereby the local county does not need to submit a yearly application if the status of Federal property within the county has not changed Indian Policies and Procedures Significant changes to the Impact Aid Indian Policies and Procedures IPPs regulations were included in the updated regulations to improve meaningful consultation between school districts and Tribes As school districts implement the additional requirements of the updated regulations we urge the Department to offer significant technical assistance support and feedback to ensure school districts can successfully complete the IPPs process In addition we ask that the Department clarify inconsistencies between the regulations and guidance that is causing

Furthermore the expansion of rape to include sex between 2 drunk individuals in highly insulting and painful to those who have experienced real rape If you want to criminalize the actions which have been incorporated into these definitions please create new terms Please stop lumping the two together It is very de legitimatizing to those who have experienced these crimes in the fullest sense

possibly have any positive outcome By taking away their personal rights we are demeaning them as people and sending the wrong message about how people should be treated Our country has come so far and endured so much pain in order to protect everyone s rights Why would we consider taking a giant step in the wrong direction Please protect our students and allow civil rights for ALL Thank you   \n",

disappointed in the judgement of your leadership to discriminate against students based on gender race and sexual preference We should celebrate diversity Diversity is what enhances the possibilities

Subtitle III Chapter III Part 300 Subpart A 300 34 Related Services I request a modification of the regulations to include Intervener Services on the list of Related Services because I have a deafblind daughter and the intervener is impairative to her communication Due to the low incidence nature of deafblindness the needs of these children to have a qualified intervener as part of FAPE are poorly understood Parents struggle to have these services considered in the IEP process because of the lack of awareness and understanding of their child s needs for these services Thanks Rhonda O

      All institutions of higher education need to maintain campus processes with standards befitting a non criminal internal proceeding to respond to sexual misconduct Most schools have an honor code that they abide by and rape definitely is a breach of that Schools can t jail offenders They can only make sure that their school does not allow those who choose to violate their classmate s rights and integrity to continue on there That is WELL within the rights of schools and does not violate the rights of offenders Attendance in higher ed is a privilege not a right and when you rape a classmate you should lose that privilege at least for as long as it takes your victim to complete their time there without fear that their rapist will continue to live in the room next to theirs be in a class with them etc To expect anything less for victims those who have had their actual rights violated in a horrible and violent manner is ridiculous and sends a message that rape will be tolerated

IX is essential to protecting students from discrimination in recruitment admissions counseling financial assistance athletics sex based harassment treatment of pregnant and parenting students discipline single sex education and employment I especially urge the Department to protect those guidelines included in the Dear Colleague Letter DCL relating to sexual assault and violence on college campuses As a college aged woman I am always fearful of my safety I take extra precautions when walking at dark I avoid walking near strangers always have my pepper in my hand keep my phone tucked away avoid eye contact walk quickly go the long way to stay on better lit sidewalks and have my keys out and ready for when I approach my apartment to go inside quickly I ve recently realized that as horrifying as being sexually assaulted would be it would be even more awful to live through the process of being questioned on everything I did to prevent the incident I do not have parental or other family support monetary or otherwise With a filled class schedule I frequently work evenings in order to have money to pay for my rent groceries and tuition and have to walk home afterwards I am genuinely afraid to do so sometimes but I have no other choice I am absolutely not alone in this situation and I know other women in college feel this way across my campus the Big Ten and the country Please do not remove guidelines that give me reassurance that my university will properly handle any sexual assault incidents that either I or my friends are likely to encounter during our time here I appreciate the Department of Education s past dedication to protecting the rights and safety of students and allowing the public to be part of this evaluation process Sincerely A Member of the Big Ten

                         I am totally against the actions of Sec DeVos in every way possible She is out to destroy education in America both on the Public school level and otherwise with her radical agenda It is disgraceful to have a Secretary of Education who is so politically and radically driven by a very ultra right agenda that is a slap in the face of justice and equality in America   \n",

Justice only 2 10 of sexual assault reports are false reports the same for other crimes like auto theft We need to believe survivors so that there can be accurate reports so we can help them and not blame them We need to uphold Title IX AND the Dear Colleague letter have Betsy actually read this not having someone summarize it for her so that survivors speak up and justice is rightfully served

emotional data collection and assessment are not the purview of public schools It is an encroachment upon parents rights for school staff to assess and then alter children s attitudes and beliefs not to mention an encroachment upon the privacy of the students themselves Social emotional data should not be collected especially if there is no notification or consent by parents or if these data are not collected by licensed psychiatrists and psychologists Any information collected must be protected by HIPAA since psychological data is medical data FERPA having been amended is no longer effective in protecting data Stealth assessments much touted in education publications are not transparent create mistrust and should not be used Please revise FERPA so that it offers strict protections of personal data Please develop prohibitions against obtaining data about students attitudes beliefs and other social emotional characteristics Please redirect educational activities toward teaching

regulations and non regulatory guidance help states and school districts fully implement the laws such as the IDEA ESSA and WIOA which are critical to ensuring students with disabilities have the same opportunities as every other kid Stakeholders rely on these authorities to assist them in understanding and complying with the statutes As such none should be modified or rescinded by the Administration Comment 2 As a citizen I firmly stand behind the laws listed below and their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to ensuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families I urge you not to modify or rescind any Civil Rights Act of 1964 Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Comment 3 For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for Americas children including students with disabilities I write to urge you not to repeal replace or modify any of the regulations or guidance that ensure they are implemented appropriately   \n",

that our government is currently considering rolling back VITAL civil rights protections for students I vehemently urge the Department of Education not to go back in time but to STRONGLY defend the rights of all students Federal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex Title IX race color and national origin Title VI and disability Americans with Disabilities Act Rehabilitation Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act The federal government must enforce the law provide oversight and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized

       "2198  June 29 2017 Marilyn Hall Acting Director Impact Aid Program Office US Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Washington DC 20202 Dear Ms Hall We write to provide input on the Impact Aid program as the US Department of Education Department engages in an agency wide directive to review all regulations per Executive Order 13777 the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools NAFIS serves as the umbrella organization for four subgroups Military Impacted Schools Association MISA National Indian Impacted Schools Association NIISA Mid to Low LOT Schools MTLLS and Federal Lands Impacted Schools Association FLISA Our members are the leaders superintendents school board members school business officers of federally impacted school districts Our organizations collectively represent the 1 200 plus Impact Aid recipient school districts nationwide that educate over 10 million students Impact Aid is the oldest elementary and secondary education program and its purpose is to reimburse school districts for a loss of local revenue due to the presence of non taxable Federal property such as military installations Indian Treaty Trust or Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act lands Federal low income housing facilities national parks and laboratories Congress recognized in 1950 that the Federal government had an obligation to help meet the local responsibility of financing public education in these communities That same recognition holds true today The staff in the Impact Aid program office work hard each day to provide customer service to more than 1 200 school districts This support includes detailed one on one technical assistance and ensuring that applications are reviewed and payments are disbursed in a timely manner We were pleased with many of the final regulations that updated the Impact Aid program in September of 2016 and provided added flexibility For example permitting multiple students from the same household to be listed on one parent pupil survey form and the so called Pentagon Rule We urge the Department to prioritize the Impact Aid office to ensure there is a full complement of staff and to prioritize modernizing the information technology system For example it is important for the staff to travel throughout the year to provide updates and technical support at conferences and school district site visits In addition we urge the Department to allocate funding to update its internal technology infrastructure for tracking applications disbursing funds and communicating with federally impacted school districts to improve efficiency security and customer service Page 2 of 3 We offer the following recommendations in response to the regulatory reform initiative Electronic Data Count Our members support the updated regulation that would allow a third option to count students within the Basic Support program The Impact Aid Office s establishment of the Electronic Data Count EDC pilot is a first step toward modernizing the application process away from an antiquated paper and pencil system We encourage the Department to codify that school districts may rely on student information systems or other technology to assist with the count and audit of federally impacted students as long as they meet the criteria for counting students As the Department continues to implement the pilot we encourage the Department to review the current regulations to determine if changes are appropriate to better align with an electronic count Federal Properties Application We urge you to use this opportunity to further streamline the application process for Federal Properties school districts We recommend a process similar to the one used by the Department of Interior to distribute annual PILT funding whereby the local county does not need to submit a yearly application if the status of Federal property within the county has not changed Indian Policies and Procedures Significant changes to the Impact Aid Indian Policies and Procedures IPPs regulations were included in the updated regulations to improve meaningful consultation between school districts and Tribes As school districts implement the additional requirements of the updated regulations we urge the Department to offer significant technical assistance support and feedback to ensure school districts can successfully complete the IPPs process In addition we ask that the Department clarify inconsistencies between the regulations and guidance that is causing confusion For example regulation 222 91 states that a waiver must be collected from each tribe that has Indian children living on Indian lands claimed by the LEA on its application This is inconsistent with our understanding of the Department s intent that the IPP consultation process need only be conducted with the local Tribe or Tribes located in the geographic area of the school district On a related matter we are encouraged by the guidance issued in a Dear Colleague Letter from...   \n",

programs that help so many young children with disabilities These programs provide vital help that comes to them at a hugely important time in their cognitive and physical development Without it many children will not have the start they need and deserve in life nor appropriate preparation for kindergarten It puts them behind other children their age instead of creating opportunities for them to thrive and for their families to learn how to help them thrive Without these programs the children and their families will receive a clear message They are not important enough They don t deserve help And that simply is not true My son received physical vision and speech therapy through early intervention and today he is a thriving 4 year old who is ready for kindergarten Without the interventions he received after his hydrocephalus diagnosis as a baby I am not sure he would be doing quite so well Early intervention is so so important And all children with disabilities deserve access to it

 Dear Assistant General Counsel Hilary Malawer We all know that there is a learning curve to assimilate to average people s needs from being a wealthy private citizen and Movie Star The needs of the People you are serving need to be your first priority The simple laws and civil rights are a protection for those People who could be harmed Sometimes we live in a tunnel vision that doesn t include the needs of other people but waking up to face that we either all succeed or we all fail What you do to even the least of my people ye have done unto me Matthew 25 40 Beware we are all Gods people All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary Far from being burdensome current civil rights rules and regulations benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that when followed allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Mary

a significant portion of our community I hope that current laws and orders on the books continue to be enforced and respected If you really want to minimize the amount of sexual assault on college campuses then mentor and lead by example with future generations of young men to respect the choices and bodies of young women Let them know that sexual assault is unacceptable and intolerable Do NOT re victimize the young women who show the courage to come forward when they have been assaulted This is not what America stands for and our young women deserve better Liberty and JUSTICE for ALL

Please do not turn back the clock on the educational civil rights of students with disabilities Disability rights are civil rights I live in Texas where there was a 12 year illegal cap on special education services enforced by the very agency that is tasked with enforcing federal education law The only saving grace was federal law was a safety net for millions of vulnerable kids who were denied an education for over a decade Sometimes we cannot trust states to enforce the law As a civil society we all benefit from all our citizens having meaningful access to public education Thank you

drinkable water This is not just about water coming from our tap but the water at its many sources These waters are still under constant threat from industrial pollution Have we come so far in advancing this cause only to slip back 40 years to a time when industry could pollute our waters with impunity I urge the government to maintain the Clean Water Rule now and forever Ken Gaines Houston

other than a white male you just can t imagine the lack of privilege others experience simply for having been born outdide that one overly glorified category Civil rights are for EVERYONE All Department of Education civil rights regulations and guidance documents are important and necessary Far from being burdensome current civil rights rules and regulations benefit schools and students by providing a clear framework that when followed allow all students an equal opportunity to learn in a safe and welcoming environment regardless of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity I urge the Department to keep in its current form 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 which include regulations governing the Secretary and the offices for Civil Rights Elementary and Secondary Education Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Career Technical and Adult Education Post Secondary Education Educational Research and Improvement and the National Council on Disability I also urge the Department to preserve all current significant guidance documents including guidance on sexual racial and disability based harassment including guidance on sexual violence access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education single sex schools equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these critical civil rights laws so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Nancy

  Current federal regulations and guidance help all studentsregardless of sex race color sexual orientation gender identity national origin or disability statusreceive the benefit of our civil rights laws That is why I am urging the Department of Education not to repeal replace or modify current civil rights regulations The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents such as the guidance on sexual harassment including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence racial and disability based harassment access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners Federal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex Title IX race color and national origin Title VI and disability Americans with Disabilities Act Rehabilitation Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act To be effective however the federal government must enforce the law provide oversight and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized Current regulations and guidance help make students rights a reality and must be maintained

college serving a large proportion of first generation students We take our mission very seriously and work hard to make the rich experience of a residential liberal arts college accessible to students who would not otherwise be able to go Many students arrive at college already wondering if they belong if they can cut it The faculty and staff at my college work to show them that they do and they can The 2011 Dear Colleague guidelines are essential to this work They protect vulnerable students survivors of sexual assault Far too many of our students fall into this category more than 11 according to RAINN I urge the Dept of Education the maintain these regulations and work with colleges and universities to reduce campus sexual assaults and make our communities safe for these

regulations and guidance help all studentsregardless of sex race color sexual orientation gender identity national origin or disability statusreceive the benefit of our civil rights laws That is why I am urging the Department of Education not to repeal replace or modify current civil rights regulations The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents such as the guidance on sexual harassment including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence racial and disability based harassment access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners Federal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex Title IX race color and national origin Title VI and disability Americans with Disabilities Act Rehabilitation Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act To be effective however the federal government must enforce the law provide oversight and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized Current regulations and guidance help make students rights a reality and must be maintained Sincerely

victims of sexual abuse We need a culture change on this issue that strongly says victims are NOT to blame and that men do not have the right to grab women for their own use like chattel You are pushing us back into the dark ages As a woman how CAN you do that Have you had such a priviledged life that you have NO understanding of or compassion for the rest of the world Please do NOT do this

educator and a parent of a teen son with a disability I firmly stand behind the laws listed below and their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to ensuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families I urge you not to modify or rescind any Civil Rights Act of 1964 Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 The potential for my son and others with disabilities is great and must be harnessed for this country to be its best economically and morally Please do the right things and fully support these laws which protect and support students with disabilities their families their communities and this nation Thank you Stacy Wenzel Chicago IL 773 391

services greatly He was born with a grade three brain bleed that caused hydrocephalus and cerebral palsy My son was not expected to be able to see hear or move his arms and legs With the assistance of early interventions services he continues to improve in various areas He is able to see track with his eyes and identify colors and shapes He is now able to sit up on his own and army crawl both of which he would not be able to do without the assistance of early on services His therapists have been an integral part of his development without whom we d be lost Removing this service would impact my son s development negatively in that his ability to socialize with peers attend school feed himself walk and communicate would betaken away from him My child is valuable as valuable as any typical child He can contribute positively to society even if he is other abled Please do not take away my child s chance at a successful life Do not alter the current early intervention services Thank You

and 2014 Sexual Violence guidance that explains a Schools responsibility to respond effectively to sexual violence against students in accordance with the requirements of Title IX LGBTQ students face a disproportionate risk of sexual assault At a time when schools already struggle to respond to sexual assault on their campuses removing the guidance will make it harder for LGBTQ survivors to get the resources and support they need The guidance is also particularly important for protecting the rights of transgender students on campus As someone who went to school with several transgender friends I ve seen firsthand how important these kinds of guidelines are when dealing with staff and administrators who might not have a very deep understanding of the challenges that face trans students I urge you to keep current regulations and guidance in place and to continue enforcing these protections so that all students have an equal opportunity to learn and thrive Sincerely Katherine

makes our country great Current federal regulations and guidance help all studentsregardless of sex race color sexual orientation gender identity national origin or disability statusreceive the benefit of our civil rights laws That is why I am urging the Department of Education not to repeal replace or modify current civil rights regulations The Department should also preserve all current significant guidance documents such as the guidance on sexual harassment including the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter containing guidance on sexual violence racial and disability based harassment access to athletic opportunities gender equity in career and technical education equal access to educational resources nondiscriminatory school discipline racial diversity programs the rights of students with disabilities in charter schools restraint and seclusion of students with disabilities and the rights of English language learners Federal civil rights laws protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex Title IX race color and national origin Title VI and disability Americans with Disabilities Act Rehabilitation Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act To be effective however the federal government must enforce the law provide oversight and proactively work to ensure that students rights are realized Current regulations and guidance help make students rights a reality and must be maintained Please do NOT get rid of rules that prohibit schools from discriminating against students based on sex race national origin or disability status They are what makes our country great   \n",

           I must strongly urge the Secretary and the Department not to get rid of rules that protect students from discrimination based on sex race ethnicity religion disability status national origin or sexual orientation To do so would be morally reprehensible and wrong It would go against the principles that are the essence of America s foundation and unpatriotic to do so It violates the consciences of most thinking and sensitive Americans who believe that principles do matter in upholding the Constitution and established law Therefore I must strongly urge the Secretary and the

a student and an activist I believe all children deserve a great education and to feel safe and welcomed in their classrooms When a school or a school district doesn t treat students fairly and allows discrimination civil rights laws required the Department of Education to step in In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have regulations or rules and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law I support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve Our education system is unfair to too many students and communities Students who are Black Latino Asian American Native American immigrants English learners girls LGBTQ or students with disabilities face too many barriers to educational success We need to use all of the tools we can to change that problem and make sure ALL children get the education they deserve Now is not the time to take these tools away or weaken them I oppose any effort to rescind modify or replace regulations and guidance that clarify our civil rights and education laws Each year I work with students throughout my county to educate them on the epidemic number of sexual assaults and harassment at K 12 schools and their Title IX rights Students are so appreciative that someone is talking to them about this problem that affects them and letting them know their rights It s the Department of Education s job to help our nation s schools provide high quality education for all children America should be a place where every child no matter their unique challenges their unique needs or where they come from can grow up to be what they

of Education to put students first by maintaining all guidance on Title II Title VI and Title IX in its current form and preserving 34 C F R pts 1 thru 1299 The 2011 Dear Colleague letter made it clear to me as a student what obligations my school had to protect me For my fellow students who were sexually assaulted in their time at school it was a critical guidepost to understand their rights Many of them felt that they were not provided a fair process which is why the Dear Colleague letter was so important to helping them understand what a fair process should look like and providing them the tools with which to hold our school accountable As a student who cares about eradicating sexual violence on my campus I believe that guidance like the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is critical in ensuring a fair process for all Not only does it help make the process fair for survivors it makes it fair and clear for those accused of sexual assault Every student deserves equal protection under the law to have an education free from discrimination whether on the basis of sex race color national origin disability status English proficiency sexual orientation or gender identity Strong enforcement of Title II VI and IX from the Department of Education is increasingly necessary Please protect the civil rights of students by maintaining all existing guidance and regulations Sincerely

       "2563  Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 The 2014 04 29 Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence letter from OCR should be rescinded Schools should not handle sexual assault cases Yes a school is obligated to respond to sexual violence however that response should be to assist the complainant in seeking medical attention preserving evidence filing a police report In cases of incapacitated force coercion that would result in proper punishment for perpetrator Numerous He Said She said cases 90 of cases where both man and woman drunk their inhibitions were down there were no witnesses it happened in one of their dorm rooms Many times the complainant refuses to seek health support or the police which directly hampers school s ability to immediately and appropriately respond When this happens there is no evidence or too much time has past for the witness statements to be relevant Under F 1 please know that adequate reliable impartial investigations are NOT done Investigations are often times poorly done the investigator is told by the school s board to with bias create the file to benefit the victim The respondent is considered guilty until proven innocent The investigative file is sloppy poorly written No recorded transcripts allowed Both the respondent and complainant are limited to what questions the investigator asks Edited statements for her only The prompt time frame is never followed F 1 is outrageous Preponderance of Evidence standard Sexual assault is a criminal offense and should have the same standard of due process This is why schools have NO BUSINESS holding hearings to determine responsibility for sexual assault F 2 it s not incarceration is inappropriate However for many wrongfully accuse respondents OR the 90 of cases where the complainant and respondent were both drunk and had regrettable sex the result for the respondent is a life crushing expulsion from college which though is not incarceration is a very damaging blow to his life path The most frequently occurring cases are where the man and woman agreed to have sex but then for some reason she wasn t really into it and the next thing you know the man has an assault charge against him Many of these cases involve regret on her part or the realization mid act that she really doesn t want to be doing this In many of these cases withdrawal of consent is NOT given She might be thinking it in her head but she does NOT actively withdraw consent In F 6 OCR should absolutely allow cross examination of a witness Often the woman just has her friends be her witness though in reality there were no witnesses to the actual encounter and her friends simply tell the investigator whatever the complainant told them to say Again the ramifications to the respondent are too big to not allow cross examination of witnesses The guidance of H 2 is ridiculous because most schools knee jerk expel the respondent immediately if found responsible OCR should mandate now that a knee jerk expulsion is discriminatory as each case needs to be handled individually Under J 4 please know that NOWHERE on a campus is there information for the men that if you have regrettable sex one day you could end up being expelled the next day Posters are only geared toward the victim When men get Title IX violation letters they don t even know what the school is talking about For every victim poster that a school puts up another poster should be required that tells the men to not have sex with that drunk girl because it could ruin your life Also please know that many women on campuses these days are equally as into it as the men One night stands are very common on campuses especially where lots of alcohol consumption takes place In all this Q A letter from OCR is out of touch with the reality of what is happening on campuses these days Men are accused sometimes wrongfully but often times in a state of confusion from the woman who didn t really have a good time and the school and her friends have convinced her that she was assaulted A completely bias investigation is done Man has to hire lawyer A hearing board is convened of members fully aware that the directive from the school board is to find all alleged respondents guilty Man is not allowed to talk directly with the complainant though many are He said She said no cross examination of the witnesses A preponderance of evidence standard is used Man is almost always found responsible each hearing treated the same He is knee jerk expelled He files an OCR complaint that he was discriminated against during the process He might sue the school More lawyer fees Woman goes back to class Rescind this letter and write a whole new policy on how schools should handle Title IX sexual assault cases which would be to immediately direct the woman to the health center and the police If she accuses better have good enough reason to tell police   \n",

       "2723  Hilary Malawer 400 Maryland Avenue SW Room 6E231 Washington DC 20202 September 15 2017 Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 0001 Dear Ms Malawer Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Department of Education s State Authorization Distance Education Regulations Comments on specific articles in the regulations are listed below Residency When determining the state in which a student resides an institution may rely on a student s self determination unless the institution has information that conflicts with that determination I agree with this means of determining a student s residency and with the statement that state authorization is based on the student s residence It would be unfathomable to determine where a student is physically located at any point in time while taking a course Consider a student who travels for work while taking a distance education course s he may be in one state on a given day and another state on the next Reciprocity Agreement I applaud the recognition and acceptance of reciprocity agreements between states to alleviate some of the complicated labor intensive and many times costly compliance requirements These agreements make it easier for institutions to offer and for students to access desired distance education courses and programs Reciprocity agreements such as SARA State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement offer a centralized authorization process a commonality and understanding of terms of agreement and requirements that serve to protect students However the regulations stipulate that a state authorization reciprocity agreement does not prohibit any state from enforcing its own statues and regulations This provision basically makes any reciprocity agreement null Professional Licensing Compliance with the professional licensure requirements may provide the biggest challenge An institution is required to provide an individualized disclosure to a prospective student if a program does not meet licensure or certification prerequisites in a state of the student s residence In the provisions a prospective student is defined as someone who has been in contact with the institution and has requested information concerning admission At an open access institution anyone may apply and be admitted to the college simply by filling out an admission application on the institution s website Prospective students may register and enroll without declaring a degree path making it impossible to know the student s intent Therefore providing an individualized disclosure statement to a prospective student may not be feasible In addition knowing the requirements for each state s licensing boards is an arduous task at best Finally receiving an acknowledgement from the student that s he has received the communication and storing that acknowledgement would require processes in place that may need programming and would require time to develop Overall I would like express my concern that some of the requirements in the regulations are overly taxing on two year public open access institutions that may not have the same resources both monetary and staffing or ease of access to counsel as four year or for profit institutions Thank you for your considerations in these matters Respectfully submitted Colleen K Eisenbeiser PhD Dean Learning Advancement the Virtual Campus Anne Arundel Community College 101 College Parkway Arnold Maryland 21012 410 777 1249 ckeisenbeiser edu   \n",

       "      <td>Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired Regulatory Reform Comments September 19 2017 Pursuit to Presidential Executive Order EO 13777 Federal agencies are directed to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to agency heads to repeal replace or modify relevant regulations Among other activities the Task Force must seek input from key stakeholders on regulations that meet certain criteria In the context of EO 13777 regulation means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effort designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency excluding specific regulations The Virginia Department of the Blind and Vision Impaired DBVI has reviewed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended the United States Department of Education DOE regulations found at 34 CFR Part 361 and the DOE Rehabilitation Services Administration RSA guidance and policy statements to identify regulatory provisions that are unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome to State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs in the administration of VR Services to individuals with disabilities Included in these comments are issues that impact DBVI s ability to provide efficient and effective services to potentially eligible and eligible individuals including students and youth who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind textbf ISSUE 1 Recordkeeping regarding the provision of Pre ETS services and the accounting for use of those funds causes Administrative Burden RSA has issued guidance and provided training regarding states responsibilities for accounting of Pre ETS expenditures that is burdensome and places unrealistic expectations for VR agencies as they attempt to document accounting of the 15 set aside funds and the provision of Pre ETS The provision of Pre ETS ensures that students with disabilities are provided with more finely tuned services that ultimately lead to better competitive integrated employment options However new data collection requirements and development of new reporting systems specific to Pre ETS causes undue administrative burden on agencies and have the unintended consequence of taking valuable time from VR Counselors and other staff that could be spent on identifying progressive ways to provide services to students textbf Recommendation Solution That RSA and State VR agencies collaborate to establish reasonable and accomplishable documentation standards for Pre ETS 15 reserved funds and case records that do not place unnecessary administrative burden on VR agencies textbf ISSUE 2 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 i A 2 and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of student with a disability and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of State cause unintended consequences DBVI is one of two designated state units DSU providing vocational rehabilitation services to people with disabilities in Virginia DBVI serves individuals who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind including students and youth 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 A 2 and 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 B 2 contain defining language of student with a disability that provides for states to elect to use lower minimum age or higher maximum age for the provision of Pre ETS as long as the minimum or maximum ages are in compliance with WIOA and IDEA respectively Guidance from RSA has been that States with two DSUs like Virginia must agree on the age at which Pre ETS must be available to students The regulatory justification for RSA s guidance is found at 34 CFR 361 5 c 48 where state is defined as any of the 50 states ldots unfortunately this definition does not account for states in which there are more than one DSU There are significant and serious unintended consequences of RSA s interpretation especially for DSUs like DBVI who is providing Pre ETS for students who are blind vision impaired and deafblind where more than 80 of total number of eligible individuals served in the VR program are older than the defined age of students with disabilities Because the population of school aged students 14 to 21 served by DBVI is much smaller than the number of students served by the general VR agency DBVI has the capacity to serve more students at an earlier age In fact DBVI could serve approximately 75 more students including middle school students if allowed to determine the minimum and maximum age at which Pre ETS could potentially begin independent of the general VR agency DBVI has found over time that providing services such as orientation and mobility instruction and assistive technology as soon as possible raises expectations for students academic accomplishments and leads to greater opportunities for employment The requirement to establish minimum and maximum ages in conjunction with the general agency causes agencies like DBVI to be unable to engage with students at the earliest possible age and to continue Pre ETS as students become older textbf Recommendation So...</td>\n",

0074 Evaluation of Existing Regulations Dear Ms Malawer I am a parent and advocate from St Charles MO I am writing in response to the U S Department of Education s ED request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration My role as a parent and advocate directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation guidance technical assistance and or other administrative activity must be whether the regulation guidance advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students Therefore COPAA believes ED s narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nation s education laws students Therefore it is on behalf of children with disabilities in Francis Howell School district in St Charles MO and their families that I make the following recommendations 1 Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws I strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Education Amendments Act of 1972 particularly Title IX The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Particularly Section 504 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA The Higher Education Act HEA The Americans with Disabilities Act ADA The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act WIOA The Carl D Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act PERKINS Freedom of Information Act FOIA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA As this relates to IDEA in particular 20 U S C Sec 1232 states The Secretary may not implement or publish in final form any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20 1983 particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education least restrictive environment related services timelines attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings or qualifications of personnel except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance 2 Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws 3 Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters 4 Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters DCL that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parent s right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA The letters to rescind are Parent s right to include invite participants to IEP meetings o Letter to Anonymous 2003 o Letter to Byrd 2003 Rationale These letters must be rescinded IDEA 20 U S C 1414 d 1 B vi and the regulations 30 C F R 300 321 a 6 and c allows parents and school district at their discretion to include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent s right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings Parent s and expert s right to observe the child in the classroom Letter to Mamas 2004 Rationale This letter must be rescinded As stated above Congress has repeatedly found that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home 601 C 5 To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom To fully participate as members of the IEP team they should have the right to observe the child s education in progress a proposed placement whether accommodations and services are being provided and other matters Independent Education Evaluations IEE The right of the family to include recommendations to the IEP team from the evaluator Letter to LaDolce 2007 Rationale This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C F R 300 503 c requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations IEE While the agency state district may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation 34 C F R 300 502 a 2 the findings and

appreciates the opportunity to respond to the U S Department of Education s ED s request for comments on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification in keeping with Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The American Speech Language Hearing Association ASHA is the national professional scientific and credentialing association for 191 500 members and affiliates who are audiologists speech language pathologists speech language and hearing scientists audiology and speech language pathology support personnel and students Audiologists specialize in preventing and assessing hearing and balance disorders as well as providing audiologic treatment including hearing aids Speech language pathologists identify assess and treat speech and language problems including swallowing disorders Audiologists and speech language pathologists SLPs who work in the schools are part of the education team and the majority of ASHA s SLP members work in a school setting They provide important and valuable services that help students access the general curriculum and can be instrumental in designing learning systems for students ASHA s members support students families and staff from early education through graduation in the context of both general and special education and as such this notice impacts ASHA members and those they serve ASHA recommends that ED provide federal guardrails to states to ensure students with disabilities have access to the necessary services they need for success textbf Family Educational Rights and Privacy FERPA Part 99 textbf Recommendation Maintain FERPA 1974 and provide harmonization with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA 1996 Harmonizing these two laws for school based services funded by both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA and Medicaid will improve efficiency and reduce redundancy in reporting emph textbf Rationale Both FERPA and HIPAA require different personal identification data requirements Schools that access IDEA funds and submit Medicaid claims are subject to both FERPA and HIPAA thereby requiring two different sets of documentation for one child The current reporting requirements do not improve student outcomes but increase administrative burden on both the school and the provider of service By harmonizing FERPA and HIPAA states school districts and providers can still protect student data privacy while improving the provision of services For example there has been some misunderstanding regarding HIPAA s and FERPA s influence on the disclosure of information from newborn hearing screening programs to primary providers This confusion can result in a loss to follow up and delays in an identified child receiving essential early intervention services textbf Nondiscrimination Under Programs Receiving Federal Assistance Through the Department of Education Effectuation of Title VI of the Civil Right Act of 1964 Part 100 textbf Recommendation In general ASHA recommends keeping the Office of Civil Rights OCR regulations and guidance at ED Any review of regulations and guidance should require stakeholder input emph textbf Rationale ED s OCR regulations and guidance provide important oversight and guidance for students and their families who participate in programs that receive federal assistance in accordance with civil rights statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA 504 and IDEA These regulations ensure that federal civil rights statutes are implemented and that programs that receive federal funds do not discriminate on the basis of race color national origin or disability In addition the regulations provide critical protections to individuals and their families particularly those individuals with communication disabilities regarding the right to access services Many students with disabilities may not qualify for services under IDEA however they may still require access to education and may qualify through other programs such as a 504 plan For example a child with hearing loss who is on grade level may still require specialized technologies and services such as remote microphone systems classroom audio distribution systems speech to text software or classroom captioning textbf in order to comprehend material presented in the school environment The OCR at ED has demonstrated an important track record of oversight and guidance assisting schools in meeting the intent of both IDEA and ADA mandates These protections are critical to students with disabilities and

       "64  Virginia Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired Regulatory Reform Comments September 19 2017 Pursuit to Presidential Executive Order EO 13777 Federal agencies are directed to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to agency heads to repeal replace or modify relevant regulations Among other activities the Task Force must seek input from key stakeholders on regulations that meet certain criteria In the context of EO 13777 regulation means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effort designed to implement interpret or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency excluding specific regulations The Virginia Department of the Blind and Vision Impaired DBVI has reviewed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended the United States Department of Education DOE regulations found at 34 CFR Part 361 and the DOE Rehabilitation Services Administration RSA guidance and policy statements to identify regulatory provisions that are unduly costly or unnecessarily burdensome to State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs in the administration of VR Services to individuals with disabilities Included in these comments are issues that impact DBVI s ability to provide efficient and effective services to potentially eligible and eligible individuals including students and youth who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind textbf ISSUE 1 Recordkeeping regarding the provision of Pre ETS services and the accounting for use of those funds causes Administrative Burden RSA has issued guidance and provided training regarding states responsibilities for accounting of Pre ETS expenditures that is burdensome and places unrealistic expectations for VR agencies as they attempt to document accounting of the 15 set aside funds and the provision of Pre ETS The provision of Pre ETS ensures that students with disabilities are provided with more finely tuned services that ultimately lead to better competitive integrated employment options However new data collection requirements and development of new reporting systems specific to Pre ETS causes undue administrative burden on agencies and have the unintended consequence of taking valuable time from VR Counselors and other staff that could be spent on identifying progressive ways to provide services to students textbf Recommendation Solution That RSA and State VR agencies collaborate to establish reasonable and accomplishable documentation standards for Pre ETS 15 reserved funds and case records that do not place unnecessary administrative burden on VR agencies textbf ISSUE 2 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 i A 2 and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of student with a disability and 361 5 c 51 B 2 definition of State cause unintended consequences DBVI is one of two designated state units DSU providing vocational rehabilitation services to people with disabilities in Virginia DBVI serves individuals who are blind vision impaired and deaf blind including students and youth 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 A 2 and 34 CFR 361 5 c 51 B 2 contain defining language of student with a disability that provides for states to elect to use lower minimum age or higher maximum age for the provision of Pre ETS as long as the minimum or maximum ages are in compliance with WIOA and IDEA respectively Guidance from RSA has been that States with two DSUs like Virginia must agree on the age at which Pre ETS must be available to students The regulatory justification for RSA s guidance is found at 34 CFR 361 5 c 48 where state is defined as any of the 50 states ldots unfortunately this definition does not account for states in which there are more than one DSU There are significant and serious unintended consequences of RSA s interpretation especially for DSUs like DBVI who is providing Pre ETS for students who are blind vision impaired and deafblind where more than 80 of total number of eligible individuals served in the VR program are older than the defined age of students with disabilities Because the population of school aged students 14 to 21 served by DBVI is much smaller than the number of students served by the general VR agency DBVI has the capacity to serve more students at an earlier age In fact DBVI could serve approximately 75 more students including middle school students if allowed to determine the minimum and maximum age at which Pre ETS could potentially begin independent of the general VR agency DBVI has found over time that providing services such as orientation and mobility instruction and assistive technology as soon as possible raises expectations for students academic accomplishments and leads to greater opportunities for employment The requirement to establish minimum and maximum ages in conjunction with the general agency causes agencies like DBVI to be unable to engage with students at the earliest possible age and to continue Pre ETS as students become older textbf Recommendation So...   \n",
       "58  To Hilary Malawer Assistant General Counsel Office of the General Counsel U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Room 6E231 Washington DC 20202 RE Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 Evaluation of Existing Regulations Dear Ms Malawer I am a parent and advocate from St Charles MO I am writing in response to the U S Department of Education s ED request for public comment on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification as directed by Executive Order 13777 and as part of the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda led by the Administration My role as a parent and advocate directs me to first tell you that the test of any regulation guidance technical assistance and or other administrative activity must be whether the regulation guidance advances educational equity and serves the interests of all students Therefore COPAA believes ED s narrow slant and sole focus in this regulatory review tilts too far toward reducing burden on entities significantly affected by Federal regulations while completely disregarding the most important entity served by our nation s education laws students Therefore it is on behalf of children with disabilities in Francis Howell School district in St Charles MO and their families that I make the following recommendations 1 Maintain all Federal Regulations pertaining to all education laws I strongly recommend that ED maintain all regulation joint regulation and guidance related to the following laws The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Education Amendments Act of 1972 particularly Title IX The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Particularly Section 504 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA The Higher Education Act HEA The Americans with Disabilities Act ADA The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act WIOA The Carl D Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act PERKINS Freedom of Information Act FOIA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA As this relates to IDEA in particular 20 U S C Sec 1232 states The Secretary may not implement or publish in final form any regulation prescribed pursuant to this Act which would procedurally or substantively lessen the protections provided to handicapped children under this Act as embodied in regulations in effect on July 20 1983 particularly as such protections relate to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education least restrictive environment related services timelines attendance of evaluation personnel at Individualized Education Program meetings or qualifications of personnel except to the extent that such regulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of the Congress in legislation I urge ED to maintain all IDEA regulations and guidance 2 Maintain all guidance pertaining to all education and civil rights laws 3 Maintain the majority of ED Memos and Dear Colleague Letters 4 Rescind a select few Dear Colleague Letters DCL that actually run counter to the IDEA and impede a parent s right to be equal partners with the school system under the IDEA The letters to rescind are Parent s right to include invite participants to IEP meetings o Letter to Anonymous 2003 o Letter to Byrd 2003 Rationale These letters must be rescinded IDEA 20 U S C 1414 d 1 B vi and the regulations 30 C F R 300 321 a 6 and c allows parents and school district at their discretion to include on the IEP team individuals with knowledge or special expertise about the child and upholds a parent s right to invite related services professionals and other IEP team members to IEP meetings Parent s and expert s right to observe the child in the classroom Letter to Mamas 2004 Rationale This letter must be rescinded As stated above Congress has repeatedly found that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home 601 C 5 To meaningfully participate parents and the experts they choose to work with support their child often need to observe the child in the classroom To fully participate as members of the IEP team they should have the right to observe the child s education in progress a proposed placement whether accommodations and services are being provided and other matters Independent Education Evaluations IEE The right of the family to include recommendations to the IEP team from the evaluator Letter to LaDolce 2007 Rationale This letter should be rescinded because IDEA 34 C F R 300 503 c requires IEP teams to consider parentally obtained independent education evaluations IEE While the agency state district may place restrictions on the criteria for the evaluation 34 C F R 300 502 a 2 the findings and recommendations of the IEE are integral to making final decisions about the child ...   \n",

September 20 2017 At Day One we partner with youth to end dating abuse and domestic violence through community education supportive services legal advocacy and leadership development Based in New York City we focus our services on young people ages 24 and under and we provide training to youth serving professionals and other adults Many Students are also Dating Sexual Violence Survivors As an organization that works with young victims of dating violence stalking and sexual violence many of our clients are students We believe that all students deserve a great education and to feel safe and welcomed in their classrooms Student survivors should not have to choose between their right to an education and their right to be safe When a school or a school district doesn t treat students fairly and allows discrimination civil rights laws require the Department of Education to step in In order to make sure that schools understand what the law requires of them and to make sure that everyone understands the protections students have regulations or rules and guidance have been developed over the past several years to clarify the law We support our civil rights laws and these tools that help to make sure students receive the protections and supports they deserve All Students deserve a right to an education free from discrimination Our education system has a long and troubled history of being unfair to too many students and communities Title IX and other anti discrimination laws protect students who identify as young women LGBTQ Black Latinx Asian American Native American immigrants English learners or students with disabilities These students regularly face too many barriers to educational success We believe the guidance issued by the Obama administration provides an essential baseline of protection that should not be diminished We oppose any effort to rescind modify or replace regulations and guidance that safeguard the civil rights of victims students and others on the basis of gender sex sexual orientation race ethnicity disability or national origin We oppose the rescission of the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter DCL that clarified schools responsibilities to prevent and respond to gender based violence under Title IX The 2011 DCL outlined steps that schools must take not only to protect survivors of gender based violence but also to protect the rights of the accused The Preponderance of the Evidence Standard adequately protects due process rights of all parties in the investigation of harassment and sexual violence We take due process rights very seriously We believe that due process is critical to seeking justice for our clients many of whom are young people of color queer identifying with differing immigration statuses We support the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter precisely because it ensured that all students both victims and those accused would have access to due process The DCL affirmed students rights to a fair and just system by outlining steps that schools should take to respond to gender based violence while ensuring due process such as Hiring a Title IX coordinator Implementing and distributing the grievance procedures for filing complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination Providing adequate reliable and impartial investigation of complaints including the opportunity for both parties to present witnesses and other evidence Allowing both parties timely and equitable access to any information that will be used at a hearing Allowing both parties equal access to legal representation Allowing both parties access to appeal any final decision Requiring University staff involved in these proceedings to have training and experience in handling complaints for sexual harassment and sexual violence The Department of Education is entrusted with the important goal of providing high quality education to all students We believe that rolling back protections for students experiencing discrimination harms not only those students but our nation as a whole   \n",
       "75  August 30 2017 Ms Hilary Malawer U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Ave SW Room 6E231 Washington DC 20202 Dear Ms Malawer The American Speech Language Hearing Association appreciates the opportunity to respond to the U S Department of Education s ED s request for comments on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification in keeping with Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The American Speech Language Hearing Association ASHA is the national professional scientific and credentialing association for 191 500 members and affiliates who are audiologists speech language pathologists speech language and hearing scientists audiology and speech language pathology support personnel and students Audiologists specialize in preventing and assessing hearing and balance disorders as well as providing audiologic treatment including hearing aids Speech language pathologists identify assess and treat speech and language problems including swallowing disorders Audiologists and speech language pathologists SLPs who work in the schools are part of the education team and the majority of ASHA s SLP members work in a school setting They provide important and valuable services that help students access the general curriculum and can be instrumental in designing learning systems for students ASHA s members support students families and staff from early education through graduation in the context of both general and special education and as such this notice impacts ASHA members and those they serve ASHA recommends that ED provide federal guardrails to states to ensure students with disabilities have access to the necessary services they need for success textbf Family Educational Rights and Privacy FERPA Part 99 textbf Recommendation Maintain FERPA 1974 and provide harmonization with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA 1996 Harmonizing these two laws for school based services funded by both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA and Medicaid will improve efficiency and reduce redundancy in reporting emph textbf Rationale Both FERPA and HIPAA require different personal identification data requirements Schools that access IDEA funds and submit Medicaid claims are subject to both FERPA and HIPAA thereby requiring two different sets of documentation for one child The current reporting requirements do not improve student outcomes but increase administrative burden on both the school and the provider of service By harmonizing FERPA and HIPAA states school districts and providers can still protect student data privacy while improving the provision of services For example there has been some misunderstanding regarding HIPAA s and FERPA s influence on the disclosure of information from newborn hearing screening programs to primary providers This confusion can result in a loss to follow up and delays in an identified child receiving essential early intervention services textbf Nondiscrimination Under Programs Receiving Federal Assistance Through the Department of Education Effectuation of Title VI of the Civil Right Act of 1964 Part 100 textbf Recommendation In general ASHA recommends keeping the Office of Civil Rights OCR regulations and guidance at ED Any review of regulations and guidance should require stakeholder input emph textbf Rationale ED s OCR regulations and guidance provide important oversight and guidance for students and their families who participate in programs that receive federal assistance in accordance with civil rights statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA 504 and IDEA These regulations ensure that federal civil rights statutes are implemented and that programs that receive federal funds do not discriminate on the basis of race color national origin or disability In addition the regulations provide critical protections to individuals and their families particularly those individuals with communication disabilities regarding the right to access services Many students with disabilities may not qualify for services under IDEA however they may still require access to education and may qualify through other programs such as a 504 plan For example a child with hearing loss who is on grade level may still require specialized technologies and services such as remote microphone systems classroom audio distribution systems speech to text software or classroom captioning textbf in order to comprehend material presented in the school environment The OCR at ED has demonstrated an important track record of oversight and guidance assisting schools in meeting the intent of both IDEA and ADA mandates These protections are critical to students with disabilities and their families and must be maintained textbf textbf ESSA Title 1 Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged textbf Part 200 textbf Recommendation ASHA recommends that ED keep the Every

specific VR services classified as Pre Employment Transition Services for students with disabilities Having an immediate effective date for these new law provisions did not allow any time for states to change their outreach strategies and develop new services to meet the new requirements much less to develop understanding of the requirements In FFY15 10 1 14 through 9 30 15 DVR came up 4 3 million dollars short of the required 15 federal expenditure rate requirement under the Pre Employment Transition Services provisions The 15 expenditure rate equaled 9 7 million dollars of the federal share for the VR program budget In addition until the Federal Regulations were published in June 30 2016 we received little guidance on implementation of this requirement Forgiveness of at least the first year if not the first two years of implementation of the Pre employment Transition Services expenditure requirement is a reasonable approach and would be beneficial to state agencies This would

ID ED 2017 OS 0074 Comments Due September 20 2017 and Please accept these comments in response to the U S Department of Education s June 22 2017 call for comment regarding unnecessary and overly burdensome regulations In the United States higher education has long been deemed an important fiscal investment for the prosperity of the nation Postsecondary education continues to contribute to social and economic mobility for individuals and families As the steward of the Federal government s investment in higher education the Department of Education ED provides procedures and guidance for institutions to comply with federal laws established for the eligibility of Title IV Federal Student Aid programs However since its inception ED s oversight has expanded and become overly burdensome for students institutions and the Department Students struggle to accurately complete the FAFSA institutions struggle to effectively follow and comply with inconsistent Federal regulations and the Department struggles to process applications and complaints and enforce regulations The onslaught of Federal regulations has caused the entire education system to spend more time and resources on compliance and risk management rather than education students and continuous improvement Today s higher education systems are struggling to modernize under increasing regulatory burdens Modernization is crucial for serving our nation and continuing to change the lives of students Our traditional views of who attends postsecondary education what is taught there and who pays for it are shifting The Department of Education has an opportunity to support the modernization of American education so that all institutions focus on student success have the flexibility to innovate and provide education that meets the needs of our changing economy The expansion of ED s regulatory oversight has significantly changed the higher education landscape and without intervention will continue to progress toward excessive federal oversight and threaten the opportunity of higher education itself In accordance with the Department s Call for Comment FR Doc ED 2017 OS 0074 the following regulations are highlighted for reform due to their impediment to higher education and the nation and being overly burdensome and costly for institutions The regulations are categorized in alignment with the areas identified in EO 13777 Eliminate Jobs Inhibit Job Creation Gainful Employment Regulations 34 CFR 668 Subpart Q The Department s regulation of gainful employment began with complex rulemaking in 2010 and the complexities continue through the Department s Dear Colleague Letters Electronic Reforming Higher Education Regulations Call for Comment Announcements and Q A documents today There have been numerous bipartisan and partisan letters from various members of Congress written to the Department and Secretary of Education since 2010 requesting the Department to cease the promulgation of the gainful employment rule These Congress members expressed the desire to ensure that federal financial aid dollars were spent wisely and that students were not misled however the gainful employment rule was ill conceived and its consequences have not been fully considered The Department s focus on defining and regulating the criteria for determining whether a program of study leads to gainful employment has clearly been directed toward vocational and career education programs at for profit institutions the very programs needed for today s evolving economy The phrase gainful employment had existed in the Higher Education Act for more than 40 years without the need for an overly complex attempt to define it Unfortunately the previous administration s focus on regulating this phrase without Congressional input has created flawed costly complicated and overly burdensome requirements for institutions There were approximately 95 000 public comments to the last Call for Comment regarding the proposed Gainful Employment rule The overwhelming majority of the comments and suggestions although answered by the Department in the Federal Register were ignored Many of the 95 000 past commenters felt that the Department was clearly focusing the rule at programs offered by for profit institutions The Department s response in the Federal Register was The regulations establish an accountability framework and transparency framework for GE programs whether the programs are operated by for profit institutions or by public or private non profit institutions However we are particularly concerned about high costs poor outcomes and deceptive practices at some institutions in the for profit sector Only non degree programs offered by public or private non profit institutions are included in the Gainful Employment rule while all programs offere...</td>\n",

membership organization for the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy P A and Client Assistance Program CAP agencies for individuals with disabilities The P A and CAP agencies were established by the United States Congress to protect the rights of people with disabilities and their families through legal support advocacy referral and education P As and CAPs are in all 50 states the District of Columbia Puerto Rico and the U S Territories American Samoa Guam Northern Mariana Islands and the US Virgin Islands and there is a P A and CAP affiliated with the Native American Consortium which includes the Hopi Navajo and San Juan Southern Piute Nations in the Four Corners region of the Southwest Collectively the 57 P A and CAP agencies are the largest provider of legally based advocacy services to people with disabilities in the United States Two critical areas of focus for the P A CAP agencies are education and vocational rehabilitation In 2016 the P As worked on nearly 14 000 individual cases related to enforcing the civil rights of students with disabilities and the CAP agencies worked on nearly 18 000 cases including information and referral related to vocational

NDRN ORG E MAIL INFO ORG Education As such the P As enforcement work is inextricably linked to U S Department of Education NDRN views the work of the U S Department of Education as critical and the effort to repeal replace or modify existing regulations and guidance as irresponsible Our concerns are detailed below For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for America s children including students with disabilities Some of these laws were enacted in response to widespread discrimination which was confronted by strong citizen activism and litigation brought by individuals facing discrimination The following laws we believe are the most significant to correcting discrimination and sustaining equity in our education system NDRN firmly stands behind these laws their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to assuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families including Civil Rights Act of 1964 Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 NDRN rejects the notion that the process the Department is engaging in in response to Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda will benefit the 50 4 million K 12 students and will aid the Department in fulfilling its stated mission to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access The process of promulgating regulations is codified in the Public Law P L 404 49 the Administrative Procedures Act APA and is a bedrock of administrative law The stated purpose of P L 404 70 is to improve the administration of justice by prescribing fair administrative procedure In describing the APA more than forty years ago Senator McCarran noted that the APA was a bill of rights for the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated by federal government agencies 2 The regulations listed for possible repeal replace or modify by the U S Department of Education have already gone through the open transparent and prescribed procedure as mandated by the APA For all regulations the rulemaking process begins after Congress passes a bill and the President signs it into law Before the draft rule is published by the federal agency it is reviewed by the Office of

       "      <td>2 1 I am writing to urge the Department of Education to uphold the protections and regulations provided by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter that allow colleges to appropriately address sexual violence on their campuses While I write these comments as a private citizen I have worked as a therapist and as an advocate for survivors of sexual violence for over five years both at a rape crisis center setting in the college filled town of Boston and in a campus setting at the University of California Berkeley I am alarmed by how proposed changes will set our country back by silencing survivors and emboldening perpetrators of violence We need to accept the reality that our students are at a high risk for sexual assault intimate partner violence stalking and sexual harassment The Association of American Universities found that among undergraduate students 23 of females and 5 4 of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force violence or incapacitation and 21 of transgender genderqueer nonconforming college students have been sexually assaulted The Department of Justice found that male college aged students 18 24 are 78 more likely than non students of the same age to be a victim of rape or sexual assault The Dear Colleague Letter has provided the necessary backing to equip colleges to intervene for their community s safety empower survivors to pursue their educational goals engage in effective violence prevention and demonstrate a commitment to addressing and ending sexual violence on their campuses Colleges are uniquely situated to address its community culture and environment to bring an end to sexual violence Colleges function as microcosms and the injuries of sexual violence reverberates throughout an expansive community that can include social groups families classrooms dorms academic programs etc As 85 90 of campus sexual assaults are committed by perpetrators that the survivor knows it is essential for universities to be able to address situations where the complainant and respondent share classes or spaces to allow both parties to participate in their education while an investigation is carried out Prior to these measures being put in place I have worked with survivors who had been forced to stop attending classes transfer schools or drop out entirely in order to look after their own safety and health Survivors need to be able to address sexual violence outside of the criminal justice system and the Title IX process allows them to do so For many survivors justice is not about seeking out the prosecution or punishment of their perpetrator Justice is being able to continue accessing education in the face of traumatic experiences they did not get to choose or control Providing a mechanism for colleges to adjudicate incidents of sexual violence utilized the trauma informed practice of offering survivors choices which increases reporting overall Relying solely on the criminal justice system or regional

which rises to a criminal level is shortsighted and will discourage survivors from coming forward to report Sexual assaults are underreported with only 20 of female student victims age 18 24 reporting to law enforcement Low reporting numbers means that survivors do not believe it is safe to come forward The most effective way to increase reporting is to offer survivors options When survivors understand the definitions of sexual violence and understand the school s resources and processes they are nearly twice as likely to utilize such resources 4 Survivors are often coping with the effects of trauma which places them at a hindrance when trying to engage law enforcement In the midst of acute trauma a survivor s priority is to feel safe and okay not to collect evidence and make a case for prosecution Survivors are also required to use their financial resources to pay for expenses related to their assaults such as their medical care enrollment and withdrawal fees counseling housing etc This can create a disproportionate advantage for perpetrators who are able to invest their funds into their legal defense The preponderance of evidence standard used by the Title IX process addresses these dynamics by placing an equal responsibility on all parties to present their case The adjudication model adopted by universities also allows for trauma informed approaches that are not available in the criminal justice system Importantly it must be noted that sexual harassment is a significant issue in colleges as 62 of female college students report having been sexually harassed at their university with 80 of the reported ...</td>\n",

99 under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA 20 USC 1232g in January 2012 the U S Department of Education USED under the Obama administration greatly diminished the privacy of millions of American schoolchildren USED should withdraw that regulation in its entirety and revert to the previous regulation and guidance issued thereunder until either the statute or the regulations or preferably both can be rewritten to address pressing issues of student data privacy The regulation in question essentially gutted the statute in several fundamental ways It abandoned the settled longstanding interpretation of the term authorized representative 34 CFR 99 3 FERPA prohibits nonconsensual disclosure of personally identifiable information PII except in several limited circumstances one of which allows disclosure to authorized representatives of certain education institutions and individuals Since at least 2003 USED had allowed such disclosure only to authorized representatives that are under the direct control of the disclosing entity i e either an employee or a contractor The 2012 regulation eliminated the direct control requirement allowing instead the disclosing entity to designate any entity or individual as an authorized representative for purposes of receiving PII This has led to a data free for all in which nongovernmental entities including non profits religious organizations foundations independent researchers and for profit companies as well as individuals could be granted access to PII without notice or consent 1 It created a broad definition of education program that includes programs not administered by an education agency under FERPA 34 CFR 99 3 This means that government officials can be given nonconsensual access to students PII from any private program that receives any federal or state aid such as preschool recreation special education or job training programs This expansion provides virtually unlimited access to education records in the name of evaluating program outcomes to any program evaluators that can convince an authorized representative that they are reviewing an education program as loosely defined in the regulation 2 To assist research studies it allowed nonconsensual redisclosure of PII that was provided by certain educational agencies and institutions to other such agencies and institutions pursuant to FERPA requirements 34 CFR 99 31 a 6 For example a state department of education would be allowed to grant researchers access to PII that the DOE received from a local school district for other purposes without the knowledge or consent of that local district or the students families whose data is being passed along USED has no legal authority to allow such redisclosure and the implied disclosure enshrined by the regulation is a lawless usurpation of statutory authority It removed the requirement previously contained in 34 CFR 99 35 a 2 that in order for a state or local educational authority to conduct an audit evaluation or 1 See Comments sflb ashx 520501ad842930 77008351 ashx 2 Ibid compliance or enforcement activity it must demonstrate authority to do so under some federal state or local grant of authority because FERPA itself does not confer such authority 34 CFR 99 35 a 1 2 Instead the SEA or LEA can simply cite audit or evaluation as justification for disclosing PII even if there is no statutory authority for the SEA LEA s action This change turns another narrow consent exception into a magic incantation by which entities with no legal authority and no intention of actually conducting audits or studies can circumvent congressional intent violate the privacy rights of students and families and obtain unfettered access to PII 3 These and other problematic provisions of the January 2012 regulation seriously undermined the privacy protections of FERPA which are already inadequate to address dangerous and increasing threats to student privacy that have arisen since the statute was enacted in 1974 FERPA must be revised to address such threats In the meantime USED can at least withdraw the January 2012 regulation and restore the protections that existed before the Obama administration gutted them 3 Ibid   \n",

specific VR services classified as Pre Employment Transition Services for students with disabilities Having an immediate effective date for these new law provisions did not allow any time for states to change their outreach strategies and develop new services to meet the new requirements much less to develop understanding of the requirements In FFY15 10 1 14 through 9 30 15 DVR came up 4 3 million dollars short of the required 15 federal expenditure rate requirement under the Pre Employment Transition Services provisions The 15 expenditure rate equaled 9 7 million dollars of the federal share for the VR program budget In addition until the Federal Regulations were published in June 30 2016 we received little guidance on implementation of this requirement Forgiveness of at least the first year if not the first two years of implementation of the Pre employment Transition Services expenditure requirement is a reasonable approach and would be beneficial to state agencies This would

       "5   Reforming Higher Education Regulations Comments in accordance with the Department of Education s Call for Comment Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 Comments Due September 20 2017 and Please accept these comments in response to the U S Department of Education s June 22 2017 call for comment regarding unnecessary and overly burdensome regulations In the United States higher education has long been deemed an important fiscal investment for the prosperity of the nation Postsecondary education continues to contribute to social and economic mobility for individuals and families As the steward of the Federal government s investment in higher education the Department of Education ED provides procedures and guidance for institutions to comply with federal laws established for the eligibility of Title IV Federal Student Aid programs However since its inception ED s oversight has expanded and become overly burdensome for students institutions and the Department Students struggle to accurately complete the FAFSA institutions struggle to effectively follow and comply with inconsistent Federal regulations and the Department struggles to process applications and complaints and enforce regulations The onslaught of Federal regulations has caused the entire education system to spend more time and resources on compliance and risk management rather than education students and continuous improvement Today s higher education systems are struggling to modernize under increasing regulatory burdens Modernization is crucial for serving our nation and continuing to change the lives of students Our traditional views of who attends postsecondary education what is taught there and who pays for it are shifting The Department of Education has an opportunity to support the modernization of American education so that all institutions focus on student success have the flexibility to innovate and provide education that meets the needs of our changing economy The expansion of ED s regulatory oversight has significantly changed the higher education landscape and without intervention will continue to progress toward excessive federal oversight and threaten the opportunity of higher education itself In accordance with the Department s Call for Comment FR Doc ED 2017 OS 0074 the following regulations are highlighted for reform due to their impediment to higher education and the nation and being overly burdensome and costly for institutions The regulations are categorized in alignment with the areas identified in EO 13777 Eliminate Jobs Inhibit Job Creation Gainful Employment Regulations 34 CFR 668 Subpart Q The Department s regulation of gainful employment began with complex rulemaking in 2010 and the complexities continue through the Department s Dear Colleague Letters Electronic Reforming Higher Education Regulations Call for Comment Announcements and Q A documents today There have been numerous bipartisan and partisan letters from various members of Congress written to the Department and Secretary of Education since 2010 requesting the Department to cease the promulgation of the gainful employment rule These Congress members expressed the desire to ensure that federal financial aid dollars were spent wisely and that students were not misled however the gainful employment rule was ill conceived and its consequences have not been fully considered The Department s focus on defining and regulating the criteria for determining whether a program of study leads to gainful employment has clearly been directed toward vocational and career education programs at for profit institutions the very programs needed for today s evolving economy The phrase gainful employment had existed in the Higher Education Act for more than 40 years without the need for an overly complex attempt to define it Unfortunately the previous administration s focus on regulating this phrase without Congressional input has created flawed costly complicated and overly burdensome requirements for institutions There were approximately 95 000 public comments to the last Call for Comment regarding the proposed Gainful Employment rule The overwhelming majority of the comments and suggestions although answered by the Department in the Federal Register were ignored Many of the 95 000 past commenters felt that the Department was clearly focusing the rule at programs offered by for profit institutions The Department s response in the Federal Register was The regulations establish an accountability framework and transparency framework for GE programs whether the programs are operated by for profit institutions or by public or private non profit institutions However we are particularly concerned about high costs poor outcomes and deceptive practices at some institutions in the for profit sector Only non degree programs offered by public or private non profit institutions are included in the Gainful Employment rule while all programs offere...   \n",

these are under the jurisdiction of the U S Department of 820 FIRST STREET NE SUITE 740 WASHINGTON DC 20002 4243 TEL 202 408 9514 FAX 202 408 9520 TTY 202 408 9521 WEBSITE WWW NDRN ORG E MAIL INFO ORG Education As such the P As enforcement work is inextricably linked to U S Department of Education NDRN views the work of the U S Department of Education as critical and the effort to repeal replace or modify existing regulations and guidance as irresponsible Our concerns are detailed below For nearly 50 years the civil rights of students including those with disabilities from infancy into adulthood have been the focus of key federal laws passed by the U S Congress These laws upheld by the courts regularly reauthorized and consistently aligned to create unified federal policy provide the strong basis to promote and uphold equity and access to a public education for America s children including students with disabilities Some of these laws were enacted in response to widespread discrimination which was confronted by strong citizen activism and litigation brought by individuals facing discrimination The following laws we believe are the most significant to correcting discrimination and sustaining equity in our education system NDRN firmly stands behind these laws their federal implementing regulations and non regulatory guidance which are essential to assuring states and school districts fulfill their obligations to students with disabilities and their families including Civil Rights Act of 1964 Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA currently known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Higher Education Act Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act WIOA amending Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 NDRN rejects the notion that the process the Department is engaging in in response to Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda will benefit the 50 4 million K 12 students and will aid the Department in fulfilling its stated mission to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access The process of promulgating regulations is codified in the Public Law P L 404 49 the Administrative Procedures Act APA and is a bedrock of administrative law The stated purpose of P L 404 70 is to improve the administration of justice by prescribing fair administrative procedure In describing the APA more than forty years ago Senator McCarran noted that the APA was a bill of rights for the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose affairs are controlled or regulated by federal government agencies 2 The regulations listed for possible repeal replace or modify by the U S Department of Education have already gone through the open transparent and prescribed procedure as mandated by the APA For all regulations the rulemaking process begins after Congress passes a bill and the President signs it into law Before the draft rule is published by the federal agency it is reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget OMB It is important to note that draft regulations are written by dedicated career staff who are independent of political affiliation The public then has 30 to 90 days to provide feedback Agencies must consider all comments document responses...   \n",
       "4   2 1 I am writing to urge the Department of Education to uphold the protections and regulations provided by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter that allow colleges to appropriately address sexual violence on their campuses While I write these comments as a private citizen I have worked as a therapist and as an advocate for survivors of sexual violence for over five years both at a rape crisis center setting in the college filled town of Boston and in a campus setting at the University of California Berkeley I am alarmed by how proposed changes will set our country back by silencing survivors and emboldening perpetrators of violence We need to accept the reality that our students are at a high risk for sexual assault intimate partner violence stalking and sexual harassment The Association of American Universities found that among undergraduate students 23 of females and 5 4 of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force violence or incapacitation and 21 of transgender genderqueer nonconforming college students have been sexually assaulted The Department of Justice found that male college aged students 18 24 are 78 more likely than non students of the same age to be a victim of rape or sexual assault The Dear Colleague Letter has provided the necessary backing to equip colleges to intervene for their community s safety empower survivors to pursue their educational goals engage in effective violence prevention and demonstrate a commitment to addressing and ending sexual violence on their campuses Colleges are uniquely situated to address its community culture and environment to bring an end to sexual violence Colleges function as microcosms and the injuries of sexual violence reverberates throughout an expansive community that can include social groups families classrooms dorms academic programs etc As 85 90 of campus sexual assaults are committed by perpetrators that the survivor knows it is essential for universities to be able to address situations where the complainant and respondent share classes or spaces to allow both parties to participate in their education while an investigation is carried out Prior to these measures being put in place I have worked with survivors who had been forced to stop attending classes transfer schools or drop out entirely in order to look after their own safety and health Survivors need to be able to address sexual violence outside of the criminal justice system and the Title IX process allows them to do so For many survivors justice is not about seeking out the prosecution or punishment of their perpetrator Justice is being able to continue accessing education in the face of traumatic experiences they did not get to choose or control Providing a mechanism for colleges to adjudicate incidents of sexual violence utilized the trauma informed practice of offering survivors choices which increases reporting overall Relying solely on the criminal justice system or regional

2015 2 Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics Rape and Sexual Victimization Among College Aged Females 1995 2013 2014 3 5 centers to address Title IX incident s which rises to a criminal level is shortsighted and will discourage survivors from coming forward to report Sexual assaults are underreported with only 20 of female student victims age 18 24 reporting to law enforcement Low reporting numbers means that survivors do not believe it is safe to come forward The most effective way to increase reporting is to offer survivors options When survivors understand the definitions of sexual violence and understand the school s resources and processes they are nearly twice as likely to utilize such resources 4 Survivors are often coping with the effects of trauma which places them at a hindrance when trying to engage law enforcement In the midst of acute trauma a survivor s priority is to feel safe and okay not to collect evidence and make a case for prosecution Survivors are also required to use their financial resources to pay for expenses related to their assaults such as their medical care enrollment and withdrawal fees counseling housing etc This can create a disproportionate advantage for perpetrators who are able to invest their funds into their legal defense The preponderance of evidence standard used by the Title IX process addresses these dynamics by placing an equal responsibility on all parties to present their case The adjudication model adopted by universities also allows for trauma informed approaches that are not available in the criminal justice system Importantly it must be noted that sexual harassment is a significant issue in colleges as 62 of female college students report having been sexually harassed at their university with 80 of the reported ...   \n",

the Impact Aid program as the US Department of Education Department engages in an agency wide directive to review all regulations per Executive Order 13777 the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools NAFIS serves as the umbrella organization for four subgroups Military Impacted Schools Association MISA National Indian Impacted Schools Association NIISA Mid to Low LOT Schools MTLLS and Federal Lands Impacted Schools Association FLISA Our members are the leaders superintendents school board members school business officers of federally impacted school districts Our organizations collectively represent the 1 200 plus Impact Aid recipient school districts nationwide that educate over 10 million students Impact Aid is the oldest elementary and secondary education program and its purpose is to reimburse school districts for a loss of local revenue due to the presence of non taxable Federal property such as military installations Indian Treaty Trust or Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act lands Federal low income housing facilities national parks and laboratories Congress recognized in 1950 that the Federal government had an obligation to help meet the local responsibility of financing public education in these communities That same recognition holds true today The staff in the Impact Aid program office work hard each day to provide customer service to more than 1 200 school districts This support includes detailed one on one technical assistance and ensuring that applications are reviewed and payments are disbursed in a timely manner We were pleased with many of the final regulations that updated the Impact Aid program in September of 2016 and provided added flexibility For example permitting multiple students from the same household to be listed on one parent pupil survey form and the so called Pentagon Rule We urge the Department to prioritize the Impact Aid office to ensure there is a full complement of staff and to prioritize modernizing the information technology system For example it is important for the staff to travel throughout the year to provide updates and technical support at conferences and school district site visits In addition we urge the Department to allocate funding to update its internal technology infrastructure for tracking applications disbursing funds and communicating with federally impacted school districts to improve efficiency security and customer service Page 2 of 3 We offer the following recommendations in response to the regulatory reform initiative Electronic Data Count Our members support the updated regulation that would allow a third option to count students within the Basic Support program The Impact Aid Office s establishment of the Electronic Data Count EDC pilot is a first step toward modernizing the application process away from an antiquated paper and pencil system We encourage the Department to codify that school districts may rely on student information systems or other technology to assist with the count and audit of federally impacted students as long as they meet the criteria for counting students As the Department continues to implement the pilot we encourage the Department to review the current regulations to determine if changes are appropriate to better align with an electronic count Federal Properties Application We urge you to use this opportunity to further streamline the application process for Federal Properties school districts We recommend a process similar to the one used by the Department of Interior to distribute annual PILT funding whereby the local county does not need to submit a yearly application if the status of Federal property within the county has not changed Indian Policies and Procedures Significant changes to the Impact Aid Indian Policies and Procedures IPPs regulations were included in the updated regulations to improve meaningful consultation between school districts and Tribes As school districts implement the additional requirements of the updated regulations we urge the Department to offer significant technical assistance support and feedback to ensure school districts can successfully complete the IPPs process In addition we ask that the Department clarify inconsistencies between the regulations and guidance that is causing confusion For example regulation 222 91 states that a waiver must be collected from each tribe that has Indian children living on Indian lands claimed by the LEA on its application This is inconsistent with our understanding of the Department s intent that the IPP consultation process need only be conducted with the local Tribe or Tribes located in the geographic area of the school district On a related matter we are encouraged by the guidance issued in a Dear Colleague Letter from...</td>\n",

Council on Governmental Relations COGR appreciate the opportunity to comment on Department of Education regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification in accordance with Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda 82 FR 28431 We write specifically with regard to 82 FR 7376 the Department of Education s Department Open Licensing Requirement for Competitive Grant Programs which requires open licensing to the public of copyrightable grant deliverables created with Department competitive grant funds Previously in December 2015 and February 2017 our associations together with others submitted comments attached on 82 FR 7376 and 82 FR 8346 respectively Our following comments are supplementary to and do not supersede any other comments made by one or more of our associations to the Department under the auspices of Executive Order 13777 First we note with gratitude the Department s responsiveness during the rulemaking process to several of the concerns we have expressed about this open licensing requirement and its ongoing willingness to address issues we have raised about its implementation Discussions between our associations and Department representatives have been productive However despite a number of improvements the Department made to the final rule we remain concerned that this regulation is overly broad and prescriptive and that the rule will limit the ability of our member institutions to form productive partnerships with the private sector to develop and disseminate Department funded materials please see our attached comments in regards to 82 FR 8376 Given the broad and diverse nature of educational materials funded by the Department we maintain a one size fits all rule is inappropriate In our view licensing decisions should be made at the local level by Department grantees who are most familiar with their materials and best understand how and when to distribute those materials Accordingly we believe the ability to choose strategically from a menu of distribution models including a range of open licensing arrangements and non exclusive and or exclusive copyright licensing better serves

Although the final rule thoughtfully added a number of exemptions case by case decisions on waiver requests inevitably will impose bureaucratic burdens on grantees and Department staff alike and create uncertainties and possible inconsistencies across the stakeholder community For the aforementioned reasons we urge the Department to substantially revise or rescind the rule We stand ready to explore ways in which stakeholders such as our institutions and their faculty can participate more fully in defining problems and developing appropriate solutions Again thank you for providing this

appreciates the opportunity to respond to the U S Department of Education s ED s request for comments on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification in keeping with Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The American Speech Language Hearing Association ASHA is the national professional scientific and credentialing association for 191 500 members and affiliates who are audiologists speech language pathologists speech language and hearing scientists audiology and speech language pathology support personnel and students Audiologists specialize in preventing and assessing hearing and balance disorders as well as providing audiologic treatment including hearing aids Speech language pathologists identify assess and treat speech and language problems including swallowing disorders Audiologists and speech language pathologists SLPs who work in the schools are part of the education team and the majority of ASHA s SLP members work in a school setting They provide important and valuable services that help students access the general curriculum and can be instrumental in designing learning systems for students ASHA s members support students families and staff from early education through graduation in the context of both general and special education and as such this notice impacts ASHA members and those they serve ASHA recommends that ED provide federal guardrails to states to ensure students with disabilities have access to the necessary services they need for success textbf Family Educational Rights and Privacy FERPA Part 99 textbf Recommendation Maintain FERPA 1974 and provide harmonization with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA 1996 Harmonizing these two laws for school based services funded by both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA and Medicaid will improve efficiency and reduce redundancy in reporting emph textbf Rationale Both FERPA and HIPAA require different personal identification data requirements Schools that access IDEA funds and submit Medicaid claims are subject to both FERPA and HIPAA thereby requiring two different sets of documentation for one child The current reporting requirements do not improve student outcomes but increase administrative burden on both the school and the provider of service By harmonizing FERPA and HIPAA states school districts and providers can still protect student data privacy while improving the provision of services For example there has been some misunderstanding regarding HIPAA s and FERPA s influence on the disclosure of information from newborn hearing screening programs to primary providers This confusion can result in a loss to follow up and delays in an identified child receiving essential

textbf Rationale ED s OCR regulations and guidance provide important oversight and guidance for students and their families who participate in programs that receive federal assistance in accordance with civil rights statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA 504 and IDEA These regulations ensure that federal civil rights statutes are implemented and that programs that receive federal funds do not discriminate on the basis of race color national origin or disability In addition the regulations provide critical protections to individuals and their families particularly those individuals with communication disabilities regarding the right to access services Many students with disabilities may not qualify for services under IDEA however they may still require access to education and may qualify through other programs such as a 504 plan For example a child with hearing loss who is on grade level may still require specialized technologies and services such as remote microphone systems classroom audio distribution systems speech to text software or classroom captioning textbf in order to comprehend material presented in the school environment The OCR at ED has demonstrated an important track record of oversight and guidance assisting schools in meeting the intent of both IDEA and ADA mandates These protections are critical to students with disabilities and

the Department of Education to recognize the existing Title IX guidance and the DCL as necessary tools in our country s efforts to end sexual violence and protect the rights of all students Sexual violence is an epidemic at our institutions of higher education According to the Bureau of Justice 21 of female students and 7 of male students will experience sexual assault during college 1 Title IX and its associated guidance play a vital role in ensuring that all college students can safely access everything their schools have to offer MCASA is certain that if the Department of Education engages attentively with a variety of stakeholders the Department will conclude that vigorous enforcement of Title IX and associated guidance is the best way forward Recently Secretary DeVos has stated that the policies currently in place have been unfair and harmful for survivors the accused and administrators but existing Title IX guidance already has ample protections in place to ensure fairness to all parties involved in a sexual misconduct investigation In fact current Title IX guidance affords even more due process than the Constitution does to all students both those accused of misconduct and those seeking protection If schools are failing to ensure fairness to all parties the solution is to rigorously enforce Title IX regulations not to undermine them It is also vitally important that Title IX guidance continues to support the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard in college investigations The preponderance of the evidence is the standard generally used in civil cases and is the standard used in other civil rights discrimination cases to hold victims of sexual violence to a different standard would be discriminatory in itself The preponderance 1

equally values the education of both parties involved in a sexual misconduct investigation which goes to the very heart of Title IX s purpose Imposing a higher standard of evidence and rolling back Title IX protections would tip the scales against survivors and would discourage them from coming forward MCASA s Sexual Assault Legal Institute SALI is a legal services program in Maryland that regularly aids student survivors of sexual violence Our clients depend on Title IX and its existing guidance to help them access their education in the aftermath of a sexual assault One client Chloe was being repeatedly harassed over the course of an evening by Mark who she had seen around but had not hung out with before 2 Eventually she went back to her dorm to get away from him but he followed her into her room Mark repeatedly asked Chloe to have sex with him and she repeatedly refused Mark persisted and eventually used a combination of coercion and physical pressure on Chloe s head to force her to fellate him Several weeks later Chloe worked up the courage to report what had happened to her school Chloe s school provided her with safety accommodations that she requested including moving Mark to a different dorm and issuing a no contact order Chloe s case caused the school to rethink its definition of sexual misconduct The following school year Chloe s school added sexual coercion to its sexual misconduct policy The school also made changes to how investigations at the school are conducted as a result of investigator bias problems that arose in Chloe s case Now students who report sexual misconduct at Chloe s school have more reassurance that investigations will be conducted fairly and impartially and the school has the ability to find perpetrators responsible for sexual misconduct when they use coercive tactics Because of Title IX Chloe was able to get the accommodations and support she needed to continue her studies during her school s investigation and her school improved its sexual misconduct policies which it may not have done had robust Title IX guidance and enforcement not been in place We cannot allow students like Chloe to suffer further after an assault because their colleges or their government refuse to support ...</td>\n",

       "21  June 29 2017 Marilyn Hall Acting Director Impact Aid Program Office US Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Washington DC 20202 Dear Ms Hall We write to provide input on the Impact Aid program as the US Department of Education Department engages in an agency wide directive to review all regulations per Executive Order 13777 the Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools NAFIS serves as the umbrella organization for four subgroups Military Impacted Schools Association MISA National Indian Impacted Schools Association NIISA Mid to Low LOT Schools MTLLS and Federal Lands Impacted Schools Association FLISA Our members are the leaders superintendents school board members school business officers of federally impacted school districts Our organizations collectively represent the 1 200 plus Impact Aid recipient school districts nationwide that educate over 10 million students Impact Aid is the oldest elementary and secondary education program and its purpose is to reimburse school districts for a loss of local revenue due to the presence of non taxable Federal property such as military installations Indian Treaty Trust or Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act lands Federal low income housing facilities national parks and laboratories Congress recognized in 1950 that the Federal government had an obligation to help meet the local responsibility of financing public education in these communities That same recognition holds true today The staff in the Impact Aid program office work hard each day to provide customer service to more than 1 200 school districts This support includes detailed one on one technical assistance and ensuring that applications are reviewed and payments are disbursed in a timely manner We were pleased with many of the final regulations that updated the Impact Aid program in September of 2016 and provided added flexibility For example permitting multiple students from the same household to be listed on one parent pupil survey form and the so called Pentagon Rule We urge the Department to prioritize the Impact Aid office to ensure there is a full complement of staff and to prioritize modernizing the information technology system For example it is important for the staff to travel throughout the year to provide updates and technical support at conferences and school district site visits In addition we urge the Department to allocate funding to update its internal technology infrastructure for tracking applications disbursing funds and communicating with federally impacted school districts to improve efficiency security and customer service Page 2 of 3 We offer the following recommendations in response to the regulatory reform initiative Electronic Data Count Our members support the updated regulation that would allow a third option to count students within the Basic Support program The Impact Aid Office s establishment of the Electronic Data Count EDC pilot is a first step toward modernizing the application process away from an antiquated paper and pencil system We encourage the Department to codify that school districts may rely on student information systems or other technology to assist with the count and audit of federally impacted students as long as they meet the criteria for counting students As the Department continues to implement the pilot we encourage the Department to review the current regulations to determine if changes are appropriate to better align with an electronic count Federal Properties Application We urge you to use this opportunity to further streamline the application process for Federal Properties school districts We recommend a process similar to the one used by the Department of Interior to distribute annual PILT funding whereby the local county does not need to submit a yearly application if the status of Federal property within the county has not changed Indian Policies and Procedures Significant changes to the Impact Aid Indian Policies and Procedures IPPs regulations were included in the updated regulations to improve meaningful consultation between school districts and Tribes As school districts implement the additional requirements of the updated regulations we urge the Department to offer significant technical assistance support and feedback to ensure school districts can successfully complete the IPPs process In addition we ask that the Department clarify inconsistencies between the regulations and guidance that is causing confusion For example regulation 222 91 states that a waiver must be collected from each tribe that has Indian children living on Indian lands claimed by the LEA on its application This is inconsistent with our understanding of the Department s intent that the IPP consultation process need only be conducted with the local Tribe or Tribes located in the geographic area of the school district On a related matter we are encouraged by the guidance issued in a Dear Colleague Letter from...   \n",

Council on Governmental Relations COGR appreciate the opportunity to comment on Department of Education regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification in accordance with Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda 82 FR 28431 We write specifically with regard to 82 FR 7376 the Department of Education s Department Open Licensing Requirement for Competitive Grant Programs which requires open licensing to the public of copyrightable grant deliverables created with Department competitive grant funds Previously in December 2015 and February 2017 our associations together with others submitted comments attached on 82 FR 7376 and 82 FR 8346 respectively Our following comments are supplementary to and do not supersede any other comments made by one or more of our associations to the Department under the auspices of Executive Order 13777 First we note with gratitude the Department s responsiveness during the rulemaking process to several of the concerns we have expressed about this open licensing requirement and its ongoing willingness to address issues we have raised about its implementation Discussions between our associations and Department representatives have been productive However despite a number of improvements the Department made to the final rule we remain concerned that this regulation is overly broad and prescriptive and that the rule will limit the ability of our member institutions to form productive partnerships with the private sector to develop and disseminate Department funded materials please see our attached comments in regards to 82 FR 8376 Given the broad and diverse nature of educational materials funded by the Department we maintain a one size fits all rule is inappropriate In our view licensing decisions should be made at the local level by Department grantees who are most familiar with their materials and best understand how and when to distribute those materials Accordingly we believe the ability to choose strategically from a menu of distribution models including a range of open licensing arrangements and non exclusive and or exclusive copyright licensing better serves

Although the final rule thoughtfully added a number of exemptions case by case decisions on waiver requests inevitably will impose bureaucratic burdens on grantees and Department staff alike and create uncertainties and possible inconsistencies across the stakeholder community For the aforementioned reasons we urge the Department to substantially revise or rescind the rule We stand ready to explore ways in which stakeholders such as our institutions and their faculty can participate more fully in defining problems and developing appropriate solutions Again thank you for providing this

       "53  The Honorable Betsy DeVos Secretary U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Washington DC 20202 Re Docket ID ED 2017 OS 0074 0001 Dear Secretary DeVos Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education This vital law affects all areas of education including recruitment admissions and housing pregnant and parenting students science technology engineering and math STEM sexual harassment and assault and athletics It requires recipients of federal education funding to evaluate their current policies and practices adopt and publish a policy against sex discrimination and implement grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee discrimination complaints I join with the

       "75  August 30 2017 Ms Hilary Malawer U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Ave SW Room 6E231 Washington DC 20202 Dear Ms Malawer The American Speech Language Hearing Association appreciates the opportunity to respond to the U S Department of Education s ED s request for comments on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal replacement or modification in keeping with Executive Order 13777 Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda The American Speech Language Hearing Association ASHA is the national professional scientific and credentialing association for 191 500 members and affiliates who are audiologists speech language pathologists speech language and hearing scientists audiology and speech language pathology support personnel and students Audiologists specialize in preventing and assessing hearing and balance disorders as well as providing audiologic treatment including hearing aids Speech language pathologists identify assess and treat speech and language problems including swallowing disorders Audiologists and speech language pathologists SLPs who work in the schools are part of the education team and the majority of ASHA s SLP members work in a school setting They provide important and valuable services that help students access the general curriculum and can be instrumental in designing learning systems for students ASHA s members support students families and staff from early education through graduation in the context of both general and special education and as such this notice impacts ASHA members and those they serve ASHA recommends that ED provide federal guardrails to states to ensure students with disabilities have access to the necessary services they need for success textbf Family Educational Rights and Privacy FERPA Part 99 textbf Recommendation Maintain FERPA 1974 and provide harmonization with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA 1996 Harmonizing these two laws for school based services funded by both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA and Medicaid will improve efficiency and reduce redundancy in reporting emph textbf Rationale Both FERPA and HIPAA require different personal identification data requirements Schools that access IDEA funds and submit Medicaid claims are subject to both FERPA and HIPAA thereby requiring two different sets of documentation for one child The current reporting requirements do not improve student outcomes but increase administrative burden on both the school and the provider of service By harmonizing FERPA and HIPAA states school districts and providers can still protect student data privacy while improving the provision of services For example there has been some misunderstanding regarding HIPAA s and FERPA s influence on the disclosure of information from newborn hearing screening programs to primary providers This confusion can result in a loss to follow up and delays in an identified child receiving essential early intervention services textbf Nondiscrimination Under Programs Receiving Federal Assistance Through the Department of Education Effectuation of Title VI of the Civil Right Act of 1964 Part 100 textbf Recommendation In general ASHA recommends keeping the Office of Civil Rights OCR regulations and guidance at ED Any review of regulations and guidance should require stakeholder input emph textbf Rationale ED s OCR regulations and guidance provide important oversight and guidance for students and their families who participate in programs that receive federal assistance in accordance with civil rights statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA 504 and IDEA These regulations ensure that federal civil rights statutes are implemented and that programs that receive federal funds do not discriminate on the basis of race color national origin or disability In addition the regulations provide critical protections to individuals and their families particularly those individuals with communication disabilities regarding the right to access services Many students with disabilities may not qualify for services under IDEA however they may still require access to education and may qualify through other programs such as a 504 plan For example a child with hearing loss who is on grade level may still require specialized technologies and services such as remote microphone systems classroom audio distribution systems speech to text software or classroom captioning textbf in order to comprehend material presented in the school environment The OCR at ED has demonstrated an important track record of oversight and guidance assisting schools in meeting the intent of both IDEA and ADA mandates These protections are critical to students with disabilities and their families and must be maintained textbf textbf ESSA Title 1 Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged textbf Part 200 textbf Recommendation ASHA recommends that ED keep the Every

Deputy Assistant General Counsel U S Department of Education 400 Maryland Ave SW Room 6E231 Washington D C 20024 Submitted Electronically via Regulations gov Dear Ms Malawer We are writing regarding fair treatment and access to education for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses The Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault MCASA is deeply concerned that rescinding the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter DCL and other existing Title IX guidance would undermine the safety of campuses across the country and discourage student survivors from reporting their assaults We write to urge the Department of Education to recognize the existing Title IX guidance and the DCL as necessary tools in our country s efforts to end sexual violence and protect the rights of all students Sexual violence is an epidemic at our institutions of higher education According to the Bureau of Justice 21 of female students and 7 of male students will experience sexual assault during college 1 Title IX and its associated guidance play a vital role in ensuring that all college students can safely access everything their schools have to offer MCASA is certain that if the Department of Education engages attentively with a variety of stakeholders the Department will conclude that vigorous enforcement of Title IX and associated guidance is the best way forward Recently Secretary DeVos has stated that the policies currently in place have been unfair and harmful for survivors the accused and administrators but existing Title IX guidance already has ample protections in place to ensure fairness to all parties involved in a sexual misconduct investigation In fact current Title IX guidance affords even more due process than the Constitution does to all students both those accused of misconduct and those seeking protection If schools are failing to ensure fairness to all parties the solution is to rigorously enforce Title IX regulations not to undermine them It is also vitally important that Title IX guidance continues to support the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard in college investigations The preponderance of the evidence is the standard generally used in civil cases and is the standard used in other civil rights discrimination cases to hold victims of sexual violence to a different standard would be discriminatory in itself The preponderance 1 Christopher Krebs et al Campus Climate Survey Validation Study Final Technical Report at 73 74 2016 available at Page 2 2 MCASA Comments re College Sexual Assault September 20 2017 standard also equally values the education of both parties involved in a sexual misconduct investigation which goes to the very heart of Title IX s purpose Imposing a higher standard of evidence and rolling back Title IX protections would tip the scales against survivors and would discourage them from coming forward MCASA s Sexual Assault Legal Institute SALI is a legal services program in Maryland that regularly aids student survivors of sexual violence Our clients depend on Title IX and its existing guidance to help them access their education in the aftermath of a sexual assault One client Chloe was being repeatedly harassed over the course of an evening by Mark who she had seen around but had not hung out with before 2 Eventually she went back to her dorm to get away from him but he followed her into her room Mark repeatedly asked Chloe to have sex with him and she repeatedly refused Mark persisted and eventually used a combination of coercion and physical pressure on Chloe s head to force her to fellate him Several weeks later Chloe worked up the courage to report what had happened to her school Chloe s school provided her with safety accommodations that she requested including moving Mark to a different dorm and issuing a no contact order Chloe s case caused the school to rethink its definition of sexual misconduct The following school year Chloe s school added sexual coercion to its sexual misconduct policy The school also made changes to how investigations at the school are conducted as a result of investigator bias problems that arose in Chloe s case Now students who report sexual misconduct at Chloe s school have more reassurance that investigations will be conducted fairly and impartially and the school has the ability to find perpetrators responsible for sexual misconduct when they use coercive tactics Because of Title IX Chloe was able to get the accommodations and support she needed to continue her studies during her school s investigation and her school improved its sexual misconduct policies which it may not have done had robust Title IX guidance and enforcement not been in place We cannot allow students like Chloe to suffer further after an assault because their colleges or their government refuse to support ...   \n",

Protections for those with ADHD are necessary for our school system. Children do not grow out of ADHD and early detection can save children from implications of being incompetent or uncooperative in an academic setting. I wish I had gotten evaluated early on in life, but as it is I had discovered that I have this disorder after dropping out of college. If I had known that my education was not catering to my needs, my academic career could have been an enjoyable one.\
